      "description": "<p>This course is part-one of the nine-part series that starts by taking an in-depth look at how the internet facilitates the movement of data packets across both LANs (Local Area Network) and WANs (Wide Area Network). Students learn how to interpret various protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPs, SMTP and FTP. We examine the entire flow and life-cycle of data-packet movement from origin to destination. The course examines the role of DNS and SMTP servers in routing internet traffic and email transmissions. Mechanism to safeguard the movement of data, such as network routers, ports and firewalls, are also explored.</p><p>Students are then introduced to the web development process and planning stages of building websites and complex web applications. We conduct an overview of web hosting infrastructures such as shared, VPS, Dedicated and Cloud hosting solutions through case analysis. We then take a look at the role of Domain name registrars and ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Students learn to register and administer domain names through the GoDaddy domain management console. Management features such as Name Server assignment, auto-renewal, domain privacy, and domain forwarding will be covered.</p><p>With first-hand insights into the creation of effective web infrastructures and domain management, students learn to configure local testing servers. This includes installing and configuring WAMP/MAMP (Windows/MAC, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on a PC or MAC system. We discuss the role of each essential service as it applies to testing dynamic, database-driven web applications on a local computing system.</p><p>Students then explore the configuration of a live production server using popular cloud hosting providers such as Linode. This includes deployment and administration of Ubuntu on Linux based distributions and essential web services (LAMP Stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on scalable virtual machines. Several remote access tools such as PuTTy and Terminal will be used to administer virtual servers through the use of command lines. Servers will be configured with security in mind, using multi-user accounts, SSH authentication, and file permission management.</p><p>Students also learn to install and connect to their virtual machines using remote desktop connection tools such as Tight VNC and Real VNC. The entire Linode management console will be explored to demonstrate how to complete various tasks including: creating backups, server re-sizing, changing root passwords, DNS management, and general administration.</p><p>Lastly, the course takes a look at FTP clients and establishing connections from local machines to production servers to upload web content. We will explore the FileZilla interface and provide demonstrations on uploading, deleting and modifying remote server files.</p>",

These powerful languages can be used to add animated, dynamic client-side functionality to any web page.<br><br>The JavaScript section of the course takes students on a journey that starts right from the basics. This includes JavaScript placement, and embedding External JavaScript code. From there, we move into variable declaration and operators for performing arithmetic. We also look at the order of operations, and different data types. Students then move into more advanced topics such as:</p><ul><li><p>JavaScript Objects</p></li><li><p>Arrays, and Array Attributes</p></li><li><p>Conditional Statements</p></li><li><p>JavaScript Comparisons and Booleans</p></li><li><p> JavaScript Loops, Functions, and Events</p></li></ul><p>The second section of the course takes an in-depth look into jQuery.

We start with foundational concepts such as embedding jQuery, and various selectors.

      "description": "<p>This course takes you step-by-step through the process of building a fully functional calculator in React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI’s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.<br><br>Through a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.<br><br>In addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer. <br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it features Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he’s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.<br><br>With that said, we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let’s get started.</p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>Welcome to the Amazon EC2 Foundations Certification course. This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term “Scalable Cloud Computing” has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world’s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 “Instance” we’re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it’s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it’s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>",

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p>",

I have generated leads at only 6 rs per lead with the help of strategy shared by you and by optimising my business manager to be ready for apple restrictions in your Udemy course. I have a facebook and instagram page since last 1 and a half years for my music academy business. Before buying your course, My cost per lead used to be 35 to 50 rs per lead through my conventional targeting. But after I studied under you, I ran conversion ads for leads by targeting custom audience of people who engaged on my facebook and instagram page and 1% lookalike audience of these custom audiences in India and it worked like a magic. 6 rs per lead is very very cheap and I am saving lot of money. Thank you so much.

It's important to know what you want to achieve in order to choose the right objective. Your advertising objective is what you want people to do when they see your ads. For example, if you want to show your website to people interested in your business, you can create ads that encourage people to visit your website. As your business grows, your campaign goals will change. First, your campaigns may focus on building awareness and acquiring new customers. Later, you may encourage people to make a purchase or sign up for an event.</p><p><em>DAY 3: Learn How to Use Facebook Ads Library</em></p><p>Facebook Ads Library was designed to give anyone and everyone accesses to advertising taking place on Facebook. This approach is to promote transparency sharing as much information as possible. You have access to a collection of all advertisements running from across Facebook Products, including Instagram.</p><p><em>DAY 4: Learn Copywriting for your Facebook Ads. Create your own Facebook Ad Copy.</em></p><ol><li><p>Put all crucial info at the start of your copy</p></li><li><p>Emojis are your best friend</p></li><li><p>Keep it brief</p></li><li><p>Give people a reason to purchase</p></li><li><p>Remember – it’s always about the sell.</p></li><li><p>Create copy tailored to your audience.</p></li><li><p>Use power words to inspire emotion.</p></li><li><p>Include social proof.</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 5: Learn How to Setup &amp; Use Facebook Business Manager</em></p><p>The purpose of Facebook Business Manager is to help you “manage ad accounts, Facebook pages, and the people who work on them — all in one place.” Business Manager is more or less the hub for accessing all of your Facebook marketing needs, including ad accounts, catalogs, pixels, and business pages.</p><p><em>DAY 6: Learn How to Proceed Domain Verification</em></p><p>Apple has announced changes with iOS 14 that impact how Facebook receives and processes conversion events from business tools like the Facebook pixel. Domain verification helps Facebook ensure that only the rightful parties can edit link previews that direct to your content. Once you have verified your domain, you can assign specific Pages editing permissions for your ads. Pages associated with your Business Manager that do not have editing permissions won’t be able to make changes to your ads.</p><p><em>It's free to verify your domains. There are 3 domain verification methods:</em></p><ol><li><p>Add a meta tag to your domain's home page</p></li><li><p>Upload an HTML file to your web directory and confirm ownership of your domain in Business Manager</p></li><li><p>Add a DNS TXT entry to your DNS record to confirm ownership of your domain</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 7: Learn How to Easily Setup Facebook Pixel &amp; Conversion API on WordPress</em></p><p>When you use the Conversions API along with our other Facebook Business Tools, you can gain additional insights into the people who interact with your business. Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.</p><p>The Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don't require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.</p><p><em>The Conversions API can help you to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity. Data from the Conversions API is less impacted than the pixel by browser loading errors, connectivity issues and ad blockers. When you use the Conversions API alongside the pixel, it creates a more reliable connection that helps the delivery system decrease your cost per action.</p></li><li><p>Optimize ads for actions that happen later in the customer’s journey. Examples of these events include actions that happen after a purchase (such as subscriptions), actions that happen in stores, or even customer scores. This information helps Facebook show your ads to customers who are more likely to be profitable and generate value for your business.</p></li><li><p>Improve measurement. The Conversions API can help you better measure ad performance and attribution across your customer’s full journey, from discovery to conversion. This helps you better understand how digital advertising impacts both online and offline results.</p></li><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of increased event matching. Your marketing data is most effective when it can be matched with accounts on Facebook apps and services. With the Conversions API, you can include additional customer information parameters that help increase matched events and your Event Match Quality score.</p></li><li><p>Increase data control. When implemented separately from the pixel, the Conversions API gives you more control over what you share and when you share it.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 8: Learn How to Use &amp; Setup Pixel Events. Learn Using Events Manager.</em></p><p>Facebook uses marketing data to show ads to people who are likely to be interested in them. One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).</p><p><em>DAY 9: Learn How to Use, Setup &amp; Optimise Facebook Aggregated Events</em></p><p>Facebook’s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads for 2023. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won’t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple’s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple’s proposal. </p><p><em>DAY 10: Learn Facebook Reach Ads</em></p><p>The reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign. You can set frequency controls for how many times a person sees your ad and the minimum number of days between each time they see it. For example, let's say you want your ads to reach a large proportion of your target audience to help increase sales. You can also tailor your reach with location targeting to reach people within a certain radius of your business location. You can simply choose the reach objective to show ads to a larger portion of your audience.</p><p><em>DAY 11: Learn Facebook Traffic Ads</em></p><p>The traffic objective is designed to drive people to your website or app. With traffic as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Send people to a destination such as a website, app, phone call or Messenger conversation (Website Clicks)</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of people going to your mobile or desktop app (App Engagement)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 12: Learn Detailed Targeting on Facebook &amp; Creating your Persona</em></p><p>Define your audience for smarter ad targeting.With Core Audiences, you set the rules for where your ads are delivered. Adjust your target audience to be as broad or well-defined as you like, based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><p>Location.Advertise in the cities, communities and countries where you want to do business.</p></li><li><p>Demographics. Choose your audience based on age, gender, education, job title and more. You can keep track of the types of people your ads are reaching, but Facebook will never share personally-identifiable information about them.</p></li><li><p>Interests. Add interests and hobbies of the people you want your ad to reach – from organic food to action films – and make your targeted ads more relevant.</p></li><li><p>Behaviour. Target your ads based on consumer behaviours such as prior purchases and device usage.</p></li><li><p>Connections. Choose to include people who are connected to your Facebook Page or event, or exclude them to find new audiences.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 13: Learn How to Create Attractive Video Carousels for Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads</em></p><p>The carousel format lets you show 2 or more images and/or videos in a single ad, each with its own headline, description, link and call to action. To scroll through a carousel, people swipe on their mobile device or click the arrows on their computer screen.</p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages. Give customers more options and help raise your clickthrough rate.</p></li><li><p>Highlight multiple features of a single product. Show different product angles or details to better educate customers.</p></li><li><p>Tell a story. Use images and/or videos in succession to illustrate a compelling narrative.</p></li><li><p>Explain a process. Walk people through how your business works step by step.</p></li><li><p>Sell the benefits. If your business is in the service industry, use images and/or videos to show the benefits to new customers.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 14: Learn about the Power of Engagement. Create Powerful Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences from Engagement.</em></p><p>Nobody knows more about us than our mother, our wife, and Facebook. So it’s very easy for Facebook to create an exact lookalike audience for you. For example, Facebook can create a very similar audience to people that have been already engaging with your content.</p><p><em>DAY 15: Learn Facebook Engagement Ads</em></p><p>The engagement objective is designed to get more people to see and engage with your Facebook post or Page. With engagement as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Boost your posts (Post Engagement)</p></li><li><p>Promote your Page (Page Likes)</p></li><li><p>Raise attendance at an event on your Page (Event Responses)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 16: Learn Facebook Lead Generation Ads</em></p><p>Lead generation is the process of building interest in a business's products or services. On Facebook, you can create campaigns using a lead generation objective that allows consumers to fill out a form, called an \"Instant Form,\" with their contact information.</p><p><em>DAY 17: Learn How to Use Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences to Get Better Results</em></p><p>A Custom Audience is an ad targeting option that lets you find your existing audiences among people who are on Facebook. A lookalike audience is a way your ads can reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they share similar characteristics to your existing customers. </p><p><em>DAY 18: Learn Conversion Ads &amp; Commerce Manager</em></p><p>The Facebook Website Conversion objective helps you to grow business on your website. Whether you want page visits, sales or another action, website conversion ads encourage people to go to your website and do something.</p><ul><li><p>Grow sales. Get people to complete transactions on your website.</p></li><li><p>Prompt an action. Define the action that you want people to take – from visiting your site, to adding something to their basket.</p></li><li><p>Increase traffic. Encourage people to visit a specific page or explore your whole website.</p></li></ul><p>Conversion ads are special kinds of ads where Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are trying their best to drive audiences to your website that are more likely to buy your products or give you a lead. For these ads you often have to retarget with custom and lookalike audiences. You mainly retarget your website visitors and already engaged people from your Facebook business page and Instagram profile. As every business is different, you can also test standard targeting based on age, interests, location and income.</p><p><em>DAY 19: Learn How to Create Attractive Carousels for E-Commerce</em></p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to sell more on your E-Commerce:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages. Give customers more options and help raise your clickthrough rate.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 20: Learn Catalog Sales (Dynamic Ads) &amp; Commerce Manager:</em></p><p>Dynamic ads are the most powerful retargeting tool that can transform all your biggest battles into great victories. They require automated synchronization with e-commerce platforms like Shopify, and correct Pixel set up as well as catalogue feeds for standard websites. They’re available for e-commerce, travel industry, automotive and real estate businesses. They help you to retarget your website visitors dynamically according to content they’ve been looking at. It can be a product, offer or even a property. They also help you to retarget people who have initiated, but never finished the check-out or payment process. Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day. 365 days a year. Once you set them up, you WIN. They work for you day and night. Nonstop. That’s why we created a special section just about Dynamic Ads and catalogues. We also give you a detailed step-by-step TO-DO list to help you set them up correctly.</p><p><em>DAY 21: Summarise with Short Animated Video Explainer &amp; Interactive Quiz</em></p><p>You need to also understand that the core essence of your success is great content combined with correct targeting and retargeting. You need to know that Facebook loves engagement. Shares are the most important, followed by comments and likes. Also, each person who gives you a like can be easily invited into your Facebook business page. This way you can easily expand the number of your followers.</p><p><em>I have done my best to create the best curriculum &amp; the Best Fast Progress Facebook Ads Course of my life.

      "description": "<p>Apache Spark Started as a research project at the University of California in 2009, Apache Spark is currently one of the most widely used analytics engines. No wonder: it can process data on an enormous scale, supports multiple coding languages (you can use Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL) and runs on its own or in the cloud, as well as on other systems (e.g., Hadoop or Kubernetes).</p><p>In this Apache Spark tutorial, I will introduce you to one of the most notable use cases of Apache Spark: machine learning. In less than two hours, we will go through every step of a machine learning project that will provide us with an accurate telecom customer churn prediction in the end. This is going to be a fully hands-on experience, so roll up your sleeves and prepare to give it your best!</p><p><strong>First and foremost, how does Apache Spark machine learning work?</strong></p><p>Before you learn Apache Spark, you need to know it comes with a few inbuilt libraries. One of them is called MLlib. To put it simply, it allows the Spark Core to perform machine learning tasks – and (as you will see in this Apache Spark tutorial) does it in breathtaking speed. Due to its ability to handle significant amounts of data, Apache Spark is perfect for tasks related to machine learning, as it can ensure more accurate results when training algorithms.</p><p>Mastering Apache Spark machine learning can also be a skill highly sought after by employers and headhunters: more and more companies get interested in applying machine learning solutions for business analytics, security, or customer service. Hence, this practical Apache Spark tutorial can become your first step towards a lucrative career!</p><p><strong>Learn Apache Spark by creating a project from A to Z yourself!</strong></p><p>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. That’s why I haven’t included any purely theoretical lectures in this Apache Spark tutorial: you will learn everything on the way and be able to put it into practice straight away. Seeing the way each feature works will help you learn Apache Spark machine learning thoroughly by heart.</p><p>I will also be providing some materials in ZIP archives. Make sure to download them at the beginning of the course, as you will not be able to continue with the project without it.</p><p><strong>And that’s not all you’re getting from this course – can you believe it?</strong></p><p>Apart from Spark itself, I will also introduce you to Databricks – a platform that simplifies handling and organizing data for Spark. It’s been founded by the same team that initially started Spark, too. In this course, I will explain how to create an account on Databricks and use its Notebook feature for writing and organizing your code.</p><p>After you finish my Apache Spark tutorial, you will have a fully functioning telecom customer churn prediction project. Take the course now, and have a much stronger grasp of machine learning and data analytics in just a few hours!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Spark Machine Learning Project (Telecom Customer Churn Prediction) for beginners using Databricks Notebook (Unofficial) (Community edition Server) </strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this Data Science Machine Learning project, we will create Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project using Classification Model Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and One-vs-Rest classifier few of the predictive models.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Explore <strong>Apache Spark</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> on the <strong>Databricks</strong> platform.</p></li><li><p>Launching <strong>Spark Cluster</strong></p></li><li><p>Create a Data Pipeline</p></li><li><p><strong>Process</strong> that data using a <strong>Machine Learning model (Spark ML Library)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hands-on learning</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Real time Use Case</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>Publish the Project on Web to Impress your recruiter</strong> </p></li><li><p>Graphical&nbsp; Representation of Data using Databricks notebook.</p></li><li><p>Transform structured data using SparkSQL and DataFrames</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>Telecom Customer Churn Prediction a Real time Use Case on Apache Spark</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Databricks: </strong></p><p>Databricks lets you start writing Spark ML code instantly so you can focus on your data problems.</p>",

      "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Functional Programming in Java with Lambda expressions (anonymous functions), Method references, and Stream API. </strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p>",

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords, credit cards and other sensitive information. <br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive, and eventually highlighted in red, bold colors on the address bar. <br><br>It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time, money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached. <br><br>There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process. <br><br>The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates. We start with the basics. Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding. <br><br>From there, we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt. We also explore setting up Cron Jobs on an Ubuntu server, to automatically renew your certificate periodically. <br><br>After completing this course, you will easily be able to secure any web page using HTTPS and free SSL certificates.</p>",

      "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Multithreading with Java Examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience the course \"</em>Artificial Intelligence in App Creation: Beginners Edition\".</p><p>Today, <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning technologies </strong>are used in diverse fields as part of the daily life of large organizations across the globe. The rapid speed of AI growth demonstrates that it is a groundbreaking technology designed to transform the way people use devices and conduct business: achievements in unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to beat people in chess and sporting games, automated customer service, and analytical systems - of course. Talking about the business, development, or marketing field, for instance, it is worth noting that Artificial Intelligence does not apply in a pure form to real self-aware intelligence machines in this sense. Instead, it can be considered a generic term for the number of software powered by automation that is being used by developers of websites and smartphone apps. They include the recognition of images and speech, cognitive computing, automated processing, and machine learning - for that matter. </p><p>Speaking of AI&nbsp;in app creation, for many years, starting with Apple's Siri, AI has already been influential in app-creation and marketing growth. It has the ability to advance even further in the coming years. Retail giants such as eBay and Amazon have already shown the ability for AI mobile applications to thrive. With new developments in technology and evolving customer expectations, the production of AI-powered mobile apps is the new digital frontier for businesses.</p><p>Further speaking, the extension of AI technology has allowed mobile users to reposition the current user experience value benchmark - altogether. Users are beginning to demand more in-depth and customized mobile app results. The output that a typical Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based app creation tool can deliver is certainly remarkable and holistic.</p><p>This course is a beginner's course that is focused on <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in App Creation</strong>. It has been created by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\". We will look at a theoretical and practical approach to the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in the field of app creation and development. A&nbsp;few cloud-based apps or tools will be covered that will help you discover new and innovative ways to convert websites into full-fledged Mobile, Windows, or Mac&nbsp;apps too.</p><p>There is no kind of technical knowledge required by you to learn this and this itself signifies that this is an easy course you can opt for immediately. </p><p><em>So, enrol now, and let us explore a new adventure in the field of app creation.&nbsp;Time to boom. </em></p><p>All the very best for your learning.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong><em>We all know that Java is the most in-demand programming language and probably 70% of coders are striving to learn it. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Java</strong> is a solid core language, by the way. It is an <strong><em>object-oriented programming (OOP)</em></strong> language. Further speaking, for those in favour of looking to learn and master <strong>Java</strong> first, we must realize the key factor. The key factor is that it teaches you to think like a true coder. As you'll <strong>learn</strong> the language, you'll also <strong>learn</strong> some key underpinnings of programming as well and this serves to be an added advantage.</p><p><strong><em>Moreover,&nbsp;Java</em></strong> is beginner-friendly - even though people are aware that Java is a statically-typed language. A statically-typed language means that your code will have to be checked for errors before it can be built into an app, by the way. Modern Java programs are now even more performant than the older ones. You really can find languages that initially are easier than <strong><em>Java</em></strong> - but learning Java has immense benefits.&nbsp;For example, Java developers are in high demand compared to other programmers (according to a popular job portal). </p><p>Java has its own unique value too - which means Java handles some of most of the complex details of the machine (computer) such as memory management, etc.&nbsp;Let's read further on what this incredible course will deliver.</p><p>This in-depth course covers all the most amazing concepts related to <strong>\"Java Classes and Objects\"</strong> in a theoretical and practical manner. Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi Ranganathan\"</strong> and Mastermind <strong>\"Saranya\"</strong> also strive to bring in new-age concepts or technology relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;programming in the final video. For example, apart from the main portions, special innovative tools like converting voice-to-code and project-planning based programming tools are covered. </p><p>So, why wait?&nbsp;Enroll now and get ready to learn Java programming.&nbsp;Finally speaking, a programming language's ability to stay relevant in an utmost manner and survive also depends on whether the language is getting new updated stuff all the time, so clearly Java will continue in the journey of domination in the years to come.</p><p>All the best for your learning endeavours!!</p>",

Let us elaborate on this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously. 'Autonomously' means that the task is not fully controlled by humans and machines play a bigger role in managing or scheduling them.</p><p>Why learn<strong> \"Digishock 2.0:&nbsp;The Ultimate Machine Learning Course of all time\"</strong>?</p><p>This mind-blowing course - the second course in the series of MBA&nbsp;in Programming and Trending Technologies titled <strong>\"Digishock 2.0: Learn Machine Learning (No Coding)\"</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"Vindhya\"</strong> takes the huge leap from&nbsp;Digishock 1.0 and is for anyone who wants to get introduced to Machine Learning and Deep Learning without learning code, whatsoever.</p><p><strong>\"Digishock 2.0\"</strong> involves hands-on exercises with numerous tricks and techniques of analytics, advanced predictive concepts to work on to ensure that all are familiarised with the discipline of machine-learning, deep-learning, big data, analytics, etc. The USP of the course is that there is no kind of technical knowledge required whatsoever for students who will participate in this course.&nbsp;What's more?&nbsp;We also will cover the topics of how you can create an app in minutes based on any software or application and start the conversion process.

Lyrebird is an AI research division within Descript, currently and the team is building a new generation of tools for media editing and synthesis that make content creation more accessible and expressive.&nbsp; Sounding to be a wow factor, this new neural voice cloning technology from Lyrebird (that is discussed in the course) synthesises the voice of a human from audio samples fed to it.</p><p><strong>What is Voice-Cloning and how this course can be the next big revolution in technology?</strong></p><p>Voice cloning corresponds to a few-shot generative speech modelling conditioned on the identity of the speaker.</p><p>Typically, cloning a voice requires hours of recorded speech to build a dataset and then use the dataset to train a new voice model. Each speaker’s embeddings can be applied to synthetically voice a random utterance or phrase - to be intact, or even users can input their own texts and the&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;tool will voice them. This means the AI tool can voice words, sentences and phrases you have not even spoken at all, for that matter.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a hand in everything from what we see on a Facebook-like social media platform to actually determining what the best treatment will be during a hospital stay. Over the last five years, AI research has grown exponentially by 19.9% annually worldwide, according to technology writers and researchers.</p><p>Smarter or High-end technologies in our factories and workplaces and connected machines that will interact, visualize the entire production chain, and in fact - make great decisions autonomously are just a couple of the methods that the Industrial AI&nbsp;Revolution will cause advancements in business.</p><p>Within the next few years (by the year 2028), China is predicted to become the biggest global source of artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI), taking over the United States (US)&nbsp;second lead — and it is quickly closing in on Europe’s number 1 spot. After China and the United States, India is the third-largest country in terms of AI research output and this is a brilliant fact.</p><p>This course \"Superminds: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\" taught by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" will highlight the key factors of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;technology in different sectors like Digital Marketing, Education or Training, Corporate industry, etc. with practical examples provided at the end of the course.</p><p>It will also go a step further into exploring the topic of whether humans and Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence machines could think alike. Finally, by 2028 or beyond, AI can be used to automate what would otherwise be a mindless, menial task or in fact all tasks done by a human.</p><p><strong>AI&nbsp;is definitely evolving and one day - it may become conscious autonomously and help us carry out or perform better decisions in every field of study.</strong></p><p><em>Let's try to envision the evolvement of AI in the upcoming years - but now try to focus on the current needs.</em></p><p>Why wait?</p><p>Enrol now and get ready to explore a smarter world with the growth of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;technologies.</p>",

A significant segment of the WordPress user community needs to learn more about the platform so that they can not only publish content but also design, customize, and manipulate their WordPress themes to make their websites look amazing. Many types of websites, such as company websites, have more content and functionality to give visitors than just blog posts, and WordPress enables you to have both a blog and a full-fledged website.</p><p>The world’s most common and commonly used content management system which is WordPress now controls 40% of all websites on the internet, but few like the most dedicated WordPress users know the true value of the platform. Besides being the most widely-used CMS, WordPress is also the fastest developing and growing. Of the top 10 million websites online, more than 500 pages created per day are operated by WordPress (versus 70-90/day that is built on run platforms such as Shopify or Squarespace). </p><p>There are also really over 60,000 plugins on the WordPress Plugin Directory, with many new plugins added daily. Most WordPress themes use what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editors, which enable users to see changes as they are made in real-time.</p><p>How well do you know WordPress? Do you think that you have mastered WordPress&nbsp;CMS? If yes, this quiz course is for you!&nbsp;If you are a WordPress developer or a digital marketer or an SEO&nbsp;expert, hop on in.

      "description": "<p>Welcome to experience <strong>\"Crash Course on Civil Engineering and AutoCAD: Part 5\"</strong>.</p><p><strong>Anyone who is willing to construct something will surely be bothered about the quality &amp; money/cost and this is where the concept of \"building estimation\" comes into the picture.</strong></p><p>We all know that an \"<strong>Estimate\"</strong> is a rough <strong>calculation</strong> of the quantities of various items of work, and the expenses likely to be incurred for the construction projects that one may undertake to complete successfully. Hence, the total of these probable expenses to be incurred on the work is known as the estimated cost of the work. The estimated cost of a work is actually a close approximation of its actual cost.&nbsp;</p><p>This fifth mind-blowing course (as part of the crash course series) focuses on&nbsp;<strong>\"Building Estimation and Quantity Surveying\"</strong>&nbsp;taught by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" and Civil&nbsp;Engineering Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\".&nbsp;It will teach you different methods of detailed construction estimation preparation. First, we will deal with the manual process of doing the same. Next, we will also discuss fast methods or approaches for estimation/preparation using online tools.</p><p>There is no time to waste.<strong><em> The course will be educative, informative, and practical at the same time.</em></strong></p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this incredible course and change your career and the whole facet of estimation forever. There are interesting, engaging, and new things to experience here, inside.</p><p>Lights. Camera.&nbsp;Action. Let us do the magic starting now.</p>",

Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

Here, students learn how to navigate the slideshow interface and create stunning slideshows from image collections using various slideshow templates. We also cover a number of tools to spruce up the overall look of a slideshow using text overlays, and embedded media objects such as music and video. Lastly, students will learn how to export a slideshow using various file formats and compression options. <br><br>After completion of the slideshow module, we dive into the print module. Here students will learn how to navigate the print module interface and setup print templates to produce studio quality images on both home and commercial grade printers.

Here students will start with exploring the Develop module interface along with the preset, and history panel. From there we will visit the collections panel before exploring a number of view options such as Loupe View and Compare view, for the ultimate in versatility when performing professional image enhancements. Students will learn to copy and paste image adjustments across a number of different images, while exploring a variety of image enhancement tools such as exposure correction, cloning, spot removal, red eye reduction, graduated filters, and white balance correction.

      "description": "<p>\"3D animation is a technique which allows for each object or person to have their own three-dimensional space; this can create the illusion of depth while simultaneously creating motion within that world.\" &nbsp;</p><p>Good 3D&nbsp;animation is hard to create or execute and we all know it. What we must further be aware of is what is harder still is being committed to it in the long run as 3D animation is a vast, tiring and long process. Animation specialists know that <strong>2D</strong> is a more simple technique - whatsoever, so it's a lot easier to learn and execute, but it still takes just as much, and even often more, time to do than <strong>3D</strong>. On top of that, 3D is a lot more complicated than 2D.&nbsp;</p><p>It's for this reason that many producers are looking into 2D production as an animation technique. It's a technique that is not new though, but quite the contrary - it has been around since the '50s, actually much longer. However, it's been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you'll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \"Life of Pi\", \"Hugo\", and \"Hayao Miyazaki's\" movies (\"The Wind Rises\" and \"Ponyo\"), they were all done in 3D. This past year saw a large rise in 3D movies than 2D movies, especially when you compare it to the years before.</p><p>The 3D&nbsp;animation process normally has three phases associated with it being - the following stages:</p><p><strong>1. Pre-production stage:</strong>&nbsp;This process includes concept creation, creating rough storyboards, making script reels, and character modelling. This is the most difficult stage of it all and also it involves a lot of brainstorming to be done by a huge team who will be working on the animation project.</p><p><strong>2. Production stage: </strong>This involves the creation of the animated film's animated elements brought together layer-by-layer and scene-by-scene, all into one place, ready for the final touches to be done or applied. This is usually termed as the \"Creation Stage\" too.</p><p><strong>3. Post-production stage:&nbsp;</strong>This stage deals with rendering of the 3D animation and editing the video using any video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, iMovie for Mac or Final&nbsp;Cut Pro (FCP).</p><p>The above phases also have multiple sub-processes within them.&nbsp;Thus, this makes 3D animation a complicated process - <strong><em>until now</em>!</strong></p><p><em>Forget being an animation specialist or learning 3D&nbsp;animation from scratch.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong><em>What if we told you that you could create amazing 3D animation videos at high speed using the world's most powerful and secretive software?&nbsp;What if we told you that this is all possible without modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting or manual animation unlike leveraging traditional animation software to create a 3D output? </em></strong></p><p>This means simply speeding up the three phases that we just talked about above by 99x. (You can create animation 99 times faster than using regular methods or software) and that's what we mean.</p><p>Welcome to the new age of 3D animation that can be generated with a single audio file you put across to the software - which we will reveal in this course. We will also look at changing characters, backgrounds colours etc. to be used in your video.</p><p>This superb and futuristic tech course has been created by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" </strong>and Mastermind<strong> \"Saranya Srinidhi\"</strong>. </p><p>Are you ready to create mind-blowing 3D virtual human avatar videos at great speed? This is going to be an exciting course, after all. </p><p>Enrol now. Let's boom.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience </em><strong><em>\"</em>Cost Accounting and Artificial Intelligence Tools\".</strong></p><p><strong>Ready to learn the basics of cost accounting with a glimpse of Artificial Intelligence technology usage in accounting?</strong></p><p><em>Cost accounting is an important aspect of an accounting policy that calculates the total cost of producing an item or providing a service by looking at all costs within the supply chain. It is done for the purpose of planning the budget and evaluating productivity. It is helpful for administrators to assess which goods, units, or programs are most efficient and which ones require enhancement.</em></p><p><em>Cost management includes assessing expenses that are fixed and adjustable. Fixed costs are losses that recur each month regardless of the manufacturing rate. Types cover leasing, depreciation, loan interest, and rental charges. Dynamic costs are expenditures that fluctuate with shifts in the level of production, such as costs of inventory, labour, and maintenance. Such costs are related to manufacturing in that the higher the units of a product produced, the greater the price associated with the materials and labour involved in the production of the item</em>.</p><p>This incredible course focusing on&nbsp;<strong><em>\"Cost Accounting and Artificial Intelligence Tools\"</em></strong> created by Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Practicing Cost and Management Accountant \"Ravi Pacha\" covers the following aspects of cost accounting which include: The meaning of cost accounting, various branches of cost accounting, functions of cost accounting, classification of cost, etc. Furthermore, we will walk you through some mind-blowing tools that leverage Artificial Intelligence in the field of Accounting to automate the complete accounting processes. While digital technology has evolved over the years, we've switched from tv to the Internet, and we're integrating Artificial Intelligence seamlessly and slowly today. John McCarthy coined the term AI for the first time in 1956. It involves many of the main things that range from robotics process automation to the actual robotics process. Because of the amount of data these types of organizations are working with, it has become highly popular with large companies today. Increasing demand for information pattern awareness has contributed to growth in the AI market. AI models are much more successful at detecting information trends than people, which help companies understand and gain insight into their target audience. Thousands of businesses around the world see AI as the next big thing for the finance industry. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can be used widely for financial transaction auditing systems. AI can also be a great help when it comes to processing a large number of pages for tax changes. Organizations dependent on AI can be expected to make major firm-related decisions in the near future. AI also has the ability to identify how consumers should respond to different circumstances and problems. Artificial Intelligence can help people and businesses make smarter choices at a very fast pace. But the key here is to find the right human-machine balance.</p><p>Get ready to go wow.

      "description": "<p>We all know that search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines like Google,&nbsp;Bing,&nbsp;Duckduckgo etc. Since search is one of the main ways people discover online content, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in website traffic. SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.&nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.</p><p>If you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO)&nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"J. Selva Antony Santosh\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;This quiz also has the room for explanatory answers that it provides. It may be a tough test for you, still.</p><p><strong><em>All the very best to score well!</em></strong></p>",

The real issue of machine intelligence and literature is always compared with the potential of what human intelligence could do and machines cannot.&nbsp;This breathtaking course is all set to rewrite history proving that machine intelligence would finally equal the limits of human creativity and even go beyond the creative imagination that we have. </p><p>The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel titled \"Erewhon\". This stemmed from his earlier (1863) essay, \"Darwin among the Machines,\" in which he raised the concept of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that could replace human beings as the dominant species. Even within films such as 'Ex Machina' or 'Chappie', a single lone genius is the first to successfully create artificial general intelligence; real-world scientists find this impossible. Anyway, let's see what this course can do to your career and life as an author.</p><p>My name is <strong>Srinidhi Ranganathan</strong>. My fans fondly call me \"Digital Marketing Legend\". Teaming up with<strong> Saranya Srinidhi, </strong>I have put this unique training course<strong><em> \"RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation - Part 5\" </em></strong>together to help authors write fiction amazingly fast and easy using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools or apps that have recently emerged in the competitive market.

A business blog, like social media, direct mail, and email marketing, is a marketing channel that aids in the growth of a company.

Bloggers, unlike in the past, do not require computer science degrees or knowledge of HTML. WordPress and “how to start a new blog” guides have made it super simple to set up a blog in 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Blog posts are more receptive to social media audiences than ads or sales pages, and blog posts are often more likely to be shared with their connections than ads or sales pages.

Responding with a blog post, rather than a sales page for your products or services, will be perceived as helpful and will naturally lead the person to your products and services, particularly if you include a good call-to-action at the end of each of your posts.</p><p>Are you curious as to why people blog? Is it really worth it to blog? For many people, blogging is a dream job. You get to be your own boss, work from home, and earn money in the background. That is why so many people start blogs in order to make money online.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the common reasons as to why people do blogging can be due to the following benefits that blogging boasts of:</p><p>1)&nbsp;Blogging helps us to earn and make money online.&nbsp;Writing good quality blog articles will play a crucial part to rank higher in search engines.</p><p>2)&nbsp;Blogging helps us express ourselves and share our passions</p><p>3)&nbsp;Blogging helps us share knowledge and insights</p><p>4) Blogging helps us gain more exposure for promoting our business</p><p>This Udemy course named <strong><em>\"RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation - Part 7\"&nbsp; </em></strong>created by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Saranya Srinidhi\" showcases furthermore incredible or practical ways that will help bloggers to write at high-speed using WordPress and popular third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools.

      "description": "<p>This Pauline letter was written to address the verbal plague that was spreading through the Church. It advocated that what Jesus did on the cross was not good enough without circumcision. Hence Paul's responses were stern and yet with an unusual <strong>depth of Old Testament revelations. </strong></p><p><strong>As an example,</strong> Paul used the story of Ishmael mocking Isaac in the book of Genesis (21v9) to explain the manner the Jewish believers were persecuting the gentile believers at that time. Galatians 4vs28<strong> \"</strong><em>Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 29</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 30</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son\".</em> </p><p><strong>We answer the following questions:</strong></p><p><strong>What is the major purpose of the book of Galatians?:</strong> We explore how Paul placed the Church on a strict \"Christ Alone\" diet as opposed to Christ and Moses/law. Paul emphasizes (as you will discover in the study) that the promise preceded the law therefore it did not set aside what God had planned that through Abraham - all the nations of the earth will be blessed.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>What is the main verses of Galatians?:</strong> We explore some of the key verses such as Galatians 3v1 <em>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes, Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</em></p><p>and </p><p>Galatians 3v<em>13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”14 He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</em></p><p><strong>What is the theme of Galatians 5?</strong> The Spirits triumph over the flesh. We learn how to live by the Spirit and not to fulfill the desires of the flesh.</p><p>All in all, we are in for a wonderful Bible Study experience. Join me as we hold hands together in the spirit and learn from this letter some life-transforming lessons that will reshape our lives! </p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>Welcome to this ultimate course on <strong>\"Insight to Post Pandemic: Importance of Lean Six Sigma\" </strong>that contains vaulable lessons taught by \"Casey&nbsp;Ang\" and \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\".</p><p>Since its introduction as a corporate strategy by Jack Welch at General Electric in 1995, Six Sigma has come a long way. Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.</p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as “A fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".</p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:</p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.</p></li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.</p></li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.</p></li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.</p></li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. </p></li></ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).</p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.</p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?</strong></p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"</strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!</p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more? We will teach you the five core skills of Lean Six Sigma that can be leveraged for individuals. We will also showcase the Lean Six Sigma organizational structure for better understanding of the concept topic.&nbsp;Other than that, we will discuss the salary range (in general)&nbsp;of various Lean Six Sigma Belts.&nbsp;These concepts will serve to be very interesting.&nbsp;All you need is passion and interest to learn and master this course!</em></p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning.

      "description": "<p>Political science is <strong>the study of politics and power from domestic, international, and comparative perspectives</strong>. It entails understanding political ideas, ideologies, institutions, policies, processes, and behavior, as well as groups, classes, government, diplomacy, law, strategy, and war.</p><p><br></p><p>August Comte opined that theories are the conceptual lenses through which we can sort out the plethora of facts that we confront daily. In fact, without theories, we might not be able to identify something as a fact at all. There are some features of a good theory. The first virtue is parsimony which implies frugality. A theory should be parsimonious to forgo unnecessary speculation and confusing details. The second feature of a sound theory is accuracy. Theories must be sufficiently detailed to allow for accurate assessments and explanations of the world. An elegant theory simply yet precisely interprets, describes, explains, or predicts some aspect of the world. However, these virtues are mostly identified as features of scientific theories. The explanatory and predictive behavior of natural sciences is not found in social sciences as too many uncontrolled and unforeseen forces affect political and social life and that is why social and political practices are seldom replicable. In light of these problems, some experts have argued that social scientists should not try to mimic the natural sciences; instead, they should develop their own standards and procedures. </p><p><br></p><p>For theorists of social and political life, therefore, the ability to feel and think in ways similar to the object of study is a crucial component of their task. In the West, political theory emerged out of political philosophy on one hand, and political thought, on the other. But it should be remembered that political theory is different from both. It differs from political philosophy in the sense that it is less formal and atomistic and less concerned to establish logical relationships between individual political concepts. Political theory is different from political thought by being less historical in focus. Thus, political theory is an essentially mixed mode of thought. It not only embraces deductive argument and empirical theory but combines them with normative concern, so acquiring a practical, action-guiding character. It is an attempt to arrive at a comprehensive, coherent, and general account of the sorts of things that we talk about when we discuss politics. A good political theorist is able to move between social conditions and political concepts. Political theory must involve a good deal of knowledge of political practice. Another aspect of political theory is that it is always defined by the specific situations and problems political thinkers have witnessed. </p><p><br></p><p>To understand political theory, we need to understand both the history of ideas on which the thinkers draw and the problems they considered themselves to be facing and to which their work was addressed. Studying the context in which political theory originally arose allows us to critically assess whose particular interests it reflected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CONTENT</strong></p><p><br></p><p>UNIT - 1: Introduction. 3</p><p>UNIT - 2: State and Sovereignty. 8</p><p>UNIT - 3: Law and Political Obligations. 8</p><p>UNIT - 4: Basic Political Values. 8</p><p>UNIT - 5: Democracy. 8</p><p>UNIT - 6: Political Ideologies. 8</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p><strong><em>Technology is a flourishing sector today, with a plethora of intriguing and innovative products as well as new learning opportunities. </em></strong>Apps and wearable technology, as well as digital fitness platforms and equipment, are among the most popular fitness technologies today. </p><p>Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.</p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.</p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of every year, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. </p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers\" </strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".</em></strong></p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life. People's communication, information seeking, music listening, meal ordering, and shopping habits have all changed as a result of them. We will also discover how technology is creating a huge impact on the fitness businesses and professionals, with even gyms changing how they deliver workout routines. What's more?&nbsp;We will be learning about wearable tech, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;on the fitness industry and unveiling the future of fitness training using the 360 Wellness App. A topic lesson on 3D&nbsp;sports prototypes will ultimately amaze you to the core. Believe it or not!</p><p>So, why wait?&nbsp;Let's get started.&nbsp;Enrol now and let's start booming.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong><em>Someone said that the Future of Social Media is \"All Talk\" and nothing more - way back in the year 2016 - believe it or not!&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>He or she who thought about this true fact is absolutely right.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>Audio-based social media stepped up to the plate in response to a pandemic-induced demand for genuine connection while avoiding screen weariness this year. Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising — a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now. Let's start booming.</p>",

A temple is dedicated to a particular god or goddess (deity). The temple is the god's home on earth. The most holy part of the temple is an inner shrine called a garbhargriha with a statue to the god or goddess. This inner shrine is under a towering roof called a sikhara. The four corners of the temple then have smaller shrines. The temple is entered through the ardhamandapa or entrance porch. Hindu temples are often decorated with the figures of gods and goddesses. Outside Hindu temples you can often buy gifts or prasad to give the deity honored in the temple.</p><p>There is no set schedule for visits to a temple. Worshippers go when they want. When entering a temple, visitors must take off their shoes and women cover their heads to show respect. The ceremony that follows is called puja. It includes prayer and a viewing of the statue of the god or goddess honored. Offerings of fruit, flowers and incense are made to a priest who presents them to the deity. After the deity blesses the gifts they are returned to the worshipper and their heads are marked with a red dot or blessing called a tilaka. Worshippers then circle the inner shrine with their right hand raised in respect to the deity.</p><p>It is also very common for Hindus to worship at a home shrine, often as a whole family. There might be a statue or just a picture of the god or goddess. The shrine also contains things which represent the five senses. The idea is to draw the whole person into worship through the image or statue and the senses. The goal is to get beyond self to Brahmin. A bell is also often rung to help focus the mind.</p><p>The Ganges River is a very sacred place to Hindus. It is a place to go on pilgrimage to bathe in sacred waters. Hindus also like to have their ashes scattered in the Ganges after cremation.</p><p>Outside Hindu temples, you can often buy gifts or prasad to give the deity honored in the temple.​</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>To highlight the sacred places in Hindu Temple​</p></li><li><p>To out the sacred spaces in Hindu Temple​</p></li><li><p>To find out the significance of sacred symbols in Hindu Temple.</p></li></ul>",

We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. </p><p>As we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. </p><p>After entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. </p><p>The course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>The course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable   </p><p>•    QuickBooks Backup files</p><p>•    Excel practice files</p><p>•    Downloadable PDF Files   </p><p>The QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.    </p><p>Who will we be learning from?   </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.   </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who is a:   </p><p>•    CPA – Certified Public Accountant   </p><p>•    CGMA – Chartered Global Management Accountant   </p><p>•    Master of Science in Taxation   </p><p>•    CPS – Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor   </p><p>•    Curriculum Development Export   </p><p>As a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.   </p><p>As a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.   </p><p>The instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

We also show lectures using the prior software versions, which will be relevant if you use an older version.</p><p><strong>This course will include backup files,</strong> a great tool to jump ahead or rework a portion of a problem. The backup files allow learners to have the exact same data as the example problem, so they can follow the presentation and perform the task in an easy, step-by-step process.</p><p>The first part of the course will demonstrate how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free, download it, and install it.</p><p>We will then use the sample file provided by QuickBooks to learn how to navigate the accounting software, locate the most commonly used areas, and understand the relationship between data input and the final product of financial statements and related reports.</p><p>The sample file is an excellent tool for learning how to navigate the software because it already has data in it, allowing us to deconstruct the process of data input by going to the end result of financial statements and drilling back to the source documents used to enter the data.</p><p>We will analyze transactions by accounting cycle: vendor cycle, customer cycle, and employee cycle. The vendor cycle may also be called the payment cycle, purchases cycle, account payable cycle, or expenses cycle. The customer cycle may also be called the revenue cycle, sales cycle, or accounts receivable cycle.</p><p>The course will break down the flow of data input forms in each cycle and the impact of each form on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>In the next major section of the course, we will start a new company file, an essential process for learning how to set up the foundational accounting system components like the chart of accounts, service items, revenue items, and beginning balances.</p><p>Learners will enter two months of data input along with instructional videos, entering a wide variety of common transactions and analyzing the impact of each on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, learners will prepare bank reconciliations using demonstration bank statements, learning how to perform a bank reconciliation, why we reconcile, and what outstanding items are.</p><p>The course also has an extensive section on how to use bank feeds. Learners will learn how to connect to the bank, download bank feeds into QuickBooks, and add the necessary data to include the bank data into the accounting system to create financial transactions or verify transactions that have already been created. We will also cover how to use bank rules to make data input much faster and more efficient. The course will demonstrate data input using bank feeds for checking, credit card, and PayPal accounts.</p><p>Next, we will enter adjusting entries; entries used to adjust financial statement reports more closely to their accounting basis as of the end of the month or year. Common accounting basis includes accrual basis, cash basis, or tax basis.</p><p>Learners will also understand how budgets fit into the accounting process, what some best practices are to construct a budget, how to enter a budget into QuickBooks, and how to run budget reports.</p><p>The course also has information on more specialized topics like using account numbers, customizing forms, using class tracking, memorizing transactions, fixed asset tracking, tax mapping, and multiple currencies.</p>",

We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excel practice files</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloadable PDF Files&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Who will we be learning from?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

Student’s questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Learning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Like assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn. Courses attempting to demonstrate all the functions Excel fail to create value for learners because learners will not retain what they learn without a foundation of core concepts and a reason for learning each new function.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will cover the fundamentals of Excel, those components used 99% of the time, and the components needed as a foundation for learning more about Excel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The core components of Excel we will learn include adding, subtracting, and summing up columns of numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will learn the core concept of Excel through demonstration, repetition, and application to practical problems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Will Be Included in This Course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will complete a comprehensive problem using both instructional video and application.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although the course offers much more than just instructional video, it does include over 20 hours of instructional video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We also include an Excel worksheet with just about every presentation allowing us to both see the completed answer and work through the problems step by step along with the video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each Excel workbook includes at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer so that we can see how the completed worksheet is constructed and the second tab will provide us the opportunity to enter the data along with the instructional video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who Will We Be Learning From?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will be learning from somebody who has practical accounting experience as a practicing CPA, teaching experience, curriculum design experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Credentials include:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are learning from someone who has both instruction and curriculum development experience needed to construct comprehensive courses of a technical nature in a way that meets students’ needs and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong> What Will We Learn?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will learn how to complete the components of the accounting cycle and the fundamental of Excel including addition, subtraction, and the sum function.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a short list of what is included in the accounting cycle and what we will cover in the course:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Journalizing journal entries</li><li>Posting to the general ledger</li><li>Create a trial balance</li><li>Adjusting entries</li><li>Bank reconciliations</li><li>Financial statement generation</li><li>Closing entries</li><li>Reversing entries</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Will We Be Taught?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will learn through viewing and then doing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will demonstrate each component of the problem in small digestible parts using both a completed Excel worksheet and instructional video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will provide an Excel worksheet that can be filled in along with the instructional video or after watching the instructional video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please join us in learning Accounting, Excel, debits, and credits.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It will be Great </strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Course Content Includes:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Start a New Business Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Set up New Company Worksheet</li><li>10 Set Up Inventory Items</li><li>15 Set Up Customer Balances</li><li>20 Set Up Vendors Beginning Balances</li><li>25 Enter Opening Account Balances</li><li>Accounting Concepts Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>135 Cash Method vs Accrual Method</li><li>132 Balance Sheet &amp; Income Statement Relationship</li><li>155 Financial Transaction Rules</li><li>160 Financial Transaction Thought Process</li><li>Enter Data for First Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Owner Deposit &amp; Loan Deposit</li><li>10 Purchase Furniture &amp; Record Investment</li><li>20 Part 1 Invoice Transaction</li><li>20 Part Two Create on Invoice Transaction</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 1</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 2</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 3</li><li>30 Cash Sales Transaction Part 1</li><li>30 Cash Sales Part 2</li><li>35 Deposit Part 1</li><li>35 Deposit Part 2</li><li>40 Part 1 Inventory Payment</li><li>40 Part 2 Inventory Payment</li><li>45 Invoice for Preordered Item Part 1.</li><li>45 Invoice for Pre-ordered Item Part 2</li><li>50 Receive Payment &amp; Make Deposit</li><li>55 Part 1 Write Check</li><li>55 Part 2 Write Check Part 2</li><li>60 Pay Bills</li><li>65 Customer Jobs</li><li>70 Payroll</li><li>75 Job Sales Receipt</li><li>80 Financial Statements &amp; Reports</li><li>90 Closing Process January</li><li>92 Worksheet Month Two</li><li>Enter Data for Second Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Make Loan Payments</li><li>10 Short Term Investment</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill Part 2</li><li>25 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>25 Part 2 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>30 Advanced Payment From Customer</li><li>35 Apply Credit to Invoice</li><li>40 Record Sales on Account</li><li>45 Advance Customer Payment</li><li>50 Bills Track &amp; Pay</li><li>55 Customer Payment on Account</li><li>60 Pay Sales Tax</li><li>65 Pay Payroll Tax</li><li>70 Enter Bills &amp; Pay Bills</li><li>75 Service Item &amp; Invoices</li><li>77 Purchase Equipment with Debt</li><li>80 Payroll</li><li>90 Rental Income</li><li>95 Financial Statements</li><li>Bank Reconciliations Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>10 Bank Reconciliation January</li><li>12 Bank Reconciliation Adjusting Entries January</li><li>15 Bank Reconciliation February</li><li>20 Bank Reconciliation Feb.

      "description": "<p>There’s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you’ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership’s viability doesn’t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don’t simply make assumptions.</p><p><br></p>",

Wouldn't it be great to know that you have the skill to make the most complex technology and make it easily understandable, memorable and desirable to the public?&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this <strong>Public Speaking</strong> for High Tech Executives course you will learn the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to avoid the most common speaking blunders made by high tech executives&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to use slide shows effectively&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to rehearse using video&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to look and sound confident and authoritative&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to get the audience talking about your messages&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this <strong>public speaking&nbsp;course</strong> takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards. Please enroll today.&nbsp; </p><p>There is a 100% Money-Back Guarantee for this course. And the instructor also provides an enhanced guarantee.<br></p><p>\"Five Stars!&nbsp;Excellent course! From Tip #1, all the content is worth the price! I'm the owner of a small consulting firm, so I need to do several presentations to sell our products and services. This course is great to get the attention of my clients and delivering much better presentations. I strongly recommend this course.

      "description": "<p><em>Welcome to learn </em><strong><em>\"</em>Influencer Content Marketing (Incredible Edition)\" now.</strong></p><p>Your website acts as the actual forefront of your business and you know it. It enables your visitors to see you in the virtual space so they can make specific assumptions and create a given brand perception.</p><p>Nevertheless, one of the most common woes for anyone running&nbsp;a business is getting a “lack of traffic” to any website or blog. We all know that a business should have a good online presence.&nbsp; Website traffic is significant and has a three-way impact: the higher the website's number of visitors! ... If you are able to increase your traffic along with the quality of the visitors, the better you will be able to increase the conversion of your website and make that traffic paying! </p><p>But believe it or not - it&nbsp;is easier said than done.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Unfortunately, the importance of search engine visibility is not understood by many website owners. They put greater emphasis on building a \"beautiful\" website. Not that this is bad, but search engine placement is really secondary. Hopefully, the list of common errors made by many website owners will help you to generate more targeted web traffic to your site - striking a loophole in the system... after all, that's not what you or we want.</p><p><strong><em>All we need is a&nbsp;focused and strategic approach of the right customers or target audience by leveraging content curation - which is content written by influencers to drive ultimate traffic to a website, video, or any landing page.</em></strong></p><p>There are secretive tools&nbsp;that you could add to your content marketing arsenal that can send the much needed targeted traffic back to your website. This course will discuss one such tool:&nbsp;<strong>Backly</strong> - the definitive magic bullet. Backly will help you to add a call-to-action to every link you share on social media. This is the power of influencer content marketing and you will realize this if you implement the tricks taught in the course.</p><p>The special lectures and growth hacking tips and tools covered in Section 2 will aid to take&nbsp;your marketing efforts to the next level.</p><p>Get ready and enrol now in influencer marketing this year!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Merhaba arkadaşlar Kurşun kalem, kuru boya kalemleri ve tükenmez kalem ile 3 boyutlu resimler yapabilme ve yaratıcılık sınırlarını zorlama eğitimidir. Başlamak için 1 resim kalemi 1 silgi ve 1 kağıt yeterlidir. Evde bulunabilecek malzeme ve materyaller ile başlayabilirsiniz. Öncelikle başlangıçta kalemleri tanımak, kalem tutuşu, hangi kalem seçimi yapacağımızı göreceğiz. Mesafe, derinlik, dolgu, tonlama, ışık-gölge, yakın-uzak ilişkisi, tümsek-çukur, tek kaçış noktalı perspektif, iki kaçış noktalı perspektif, üç kaçış noktalı perspektif çizimleri yapacağız. Ayrıca imgesel de çalışacağız yani hayal gücüne dayalı rastgele olacak. Yaratıcılığı artırıcı ve bakış açısını değiştiren bir eğitim olacaktır. Artık öğrencilerim çok yönlü bakıp düşünebilecekler. Bunun haricinde bakarak obje, nesne çizimi yapabilecekler. 3 boyutlu çizimlerin çeşitlerinden bahsedeceğiz bunun içerisinde kağıt kesme işlemi yaparak da farklı 3 boyutlu çizimler de yapacağız. Bu eğitimin en güzel yanı da 7 yaş ve üzeri her yaşa hitap etmesidir. </p><p>Yalnız resim işi severek isteyerek yapmakla olur. Kimi çalışmalar uzun süre uğraş verilmesi isteyebilir. Bu eğitim sadece el becerisi zannedilmesin ilk başta bakış açısını değiştirerek analitik düşünmeyi sağlayacaktır. </p><p>Daha önce yüz yüze verdiğim 8-10 yaş eğitim grubumdan velilerden çok güzel geri dönüşler aldım. Ayrıca sergilere resimlerim davet edildi. İlkokula başlamadan resme olan merakım çevremdekiler tarafından fark edildi. Orta okul ve lisede de yaptığım resimler dikkat çekti. Ta ki evlenip çocuğum olana kadar ve çocuğum benden sürekli hayvan resimleri çizmemi istediğinden hayvan figürleri sonrasında da 3 boyutlu çizime yöneldim. Bu resimler paylaşımlarımda inanılmaz beğenildi. </p><p>Unutmayın aynı resme bakan herkes aynı şeyi göremez.</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>Hello friends It is a training to make 3D pictures with pencils, dry crayons and ballpoint pens and to push the limits of creativity.&nbsp; To get started, 1 art pen, 1 eraser and 1 piece of paper are enough.&nbsp; You can start with supplies and materials that can be found at home.&nbsp; First of all, we will see at the beginning to get to know the pencils, pencil grip, which pencil we will choose.&nbsp; We will draw distance, depth, filling, toning, light-shadow, close-distance relationship, bump-pit, perspective with one vanishing point, perspective with two vanishing points, and perspective with three vanishing points.&nbsp; We're also going to work imaginatively, so it's going to be imaginatively random.&nbsp; It will be an education that increases creativity and changes the perspective.&nbsp; Now my students will be able to look and think from multiple angles.&nbsp; Apart from this, they will be able to draw objects and objects by looking.&nbsp; We will talk about the types of 3D drawings, and we will also make different 3D drawings by cutting paper.&nbsp; The best part of this training is that it appeals to all ages 7 years and older.</p><p><br></p><p>Painting is possible only by doing it willingly.&nbsp; Some jobs may require a long effort.&nbsp; This training will not only be considered as a manual skill, but will change the perspective and provide analytical thinking.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> I received very good feedback from the parents of my 8-10 age group, which I gave face to face before.&nbsp; In addition, my paintings were invited to exhibitions.&nbsp; Before I started primary school, my interest in painting was noticed by those around me.&nbsp; The pictures I made in middle and high school drew attention.&nbsp; I turned to 3D drawing after animal figures until I got married and had a child and my child constantly asked me to draw animal pictures.&nbsp; These pictures received incredible likes on my posts.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Remember, not everyone who looks at the same picture can see the same thing.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Personal Branding</strong>.&nbsp;Imagine delivering an elevator pitch to an executive who holds the future to your dreams, and the person says \"sounds interesting, please call my office and schedule a meeting. I'd like to talk to you in more depth about this idea.\" Wouldn't it be great to know that you can entice anyone into wanting a meeting with you after just a 30 second conversation? Nothing will enhance your <strong>personal branding</strong> as much as the ability to communicate an elevator pitch in a concise and compelling manner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this How to Deliver an Elevator Pitch course you will learn the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to craft a tight, focused elevator pitch&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to rehearse on video&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to appear confident and relaxed&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to make sure your message is interesting and memorable&nbsp; </p><p>*How to demonstrate excellent <strong>personal branding</strong></p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards. Please enroll today.&nbsp; </p><p>Course updated on July 30, 2015</p><p>There is a 100% Money-Back Guarantee for this course. And the instructor also provides an enhanced guarantee.</p><p>What others say about this personal branding course:</p><p>\"5 Stars!&nbsp;Despite having been a speaker for many years and taken several colleges, online and private lessons, I found myself drawn to listen to TJ Walker, and I am thrilled to learn from this master of communications! He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today's environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker's delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\"&nbsp;Debbie Tudor<br></p><p>What others say about the instructor:<br></p><p>“TJ Walker's single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\" <em>Bob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television</em></p><p>“TJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\" <em>Stu Miller, Viacom News Producer</em></p><p>(TJ Walker's Media Training Worldwide) “The world's leading presentation and media training firm.\"<em>Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor</em></p><p><br></p>",

The vendor cycle may also be called the payment cycle, purchases cycle, account payable cycle, or expenses cycle. The customer cycle may also be called the revenue cycle, sales cycle, or accounts receivable cycle.</p><p>The course will break down the flow of data input forms in each cycle and the impact of each form on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>In the next major section of the course, we will start a new company file, an essential process for learning how to set up the foundational accounting system components like the chart of accounts, service items, revenue items, and beginning balances.</p><p>Learners will enter two months of data input along with instructional videos, entering a wide variety of common transactions and analyzing the impact of each on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, learners will prepare bank reconciliations using demonstration bank statements, learning how to perform a bank reconciliation, why we reconcile, and what outstanding items are.</p><p>The course also has an extensive section on how to use bank feeds. Learners will learn how to connect to the bank, download bank feeds into QuickBooks, and add the necessary data to include the bank data into the accounting system to create financial transactions or verify transactions that have already been created. We will also cover how to use bank rules to make data input much faster and more efficient. The course will demonstrate data input using bank feeds for checking, credit card, and PayPal accounts.</p><p>Next, we will enter adjusting entries; entries used to adjust financial statement reports more closely to their accounting basis as of the end of the month or year. Common accounting basis includes accrual basis, cash basis, or tax basis.</p><p>Learners will also understand how budgets fit into the accounting process, what some best practices are to construct a budget, how to enter a budget into QuickBooks, and how to run budget reports.</p><p>The course also has information on more specialized topics like using account numbers, customizing forms, using class tracking, memorizing transactions, and multiple currencies.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.</p><p>The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.</p><p>We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor’s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company’s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1. Describe what an audit engagement is and the objectives of the audit engagement</p><p>2. Explain how learning the audit process can enhance an accountant’s understanding of financial accounting concepts</p><p>3. Discuss the general format and structure of a public accounting firm</p><p>4. Outline the general format and structure of an audit team</p><p>5. Describe how to plan an audit</p><p>6. Explain how to assess risk and use risk assessment in the planning process</p><p>7. Discuss the concept of materiality and how it applies to audit planning and procedures</p><p>8. Outline internal controls, tests of internal controls, and the role they play in the audit process</p><p>9. List audit sampling procedures</p><p>10. List substantive testing procedures</p><p>11. Discuss audit testing procedures related to the revenue process</p><p>12. Explain audit testing procedures related to the purchasing process</p><p>13.

      "description": "<p>FINALLY,<strong> THE 5 KEY LEARNING</strong> CONCEPTS TO <strong>MASTER </strong>ANY SKILL <strong>EFFORTLESSLY.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>NO&nbsp;WILLPOWER&nbsp;REQUIRED!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If you are reading this page, you probably struggle with your studies, either at university, or aside from your full-time job. If so, you are in the <strong>RIGHT </strong>place.</p><p><strong><br>How many times have you found yourself having to study and being stressed?&nbsp; Not being able to&nbsp;get started, and procrastinating? When you get enough traction to learn for 2 minutes, and then your focus shifts somewhere else…</strong></p><p><strong>Does that seem familiar?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hi there!</p><p>My name is Marcel. I am a <em>Life Coach</em> and a <em>Scientist</em>, and I have studied for many many years. In fact, to this date, I continue learning every day while working on a full time job. Since very little, I have been obsessed with productivity and how to do things faster and better, and learning more quickly always seemed like a superpower. If I could learn fast, I thought, I can do whatever! I can learn it all by myself!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let me tell you a little bit of my story...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I remember <em>vividly </em>that day. I was in front of my notes. I had to study for the ‘Antennas’ exam for my telecom bachelor. I thought two days were enough to learn a whole semester of material. However, I was confident I could do it. I had attended all the lectures and did the exercises, and although it all felt like a ball of concepts that were not yet understood and untangled, I was confident I could pass that exam.</p><p>The first hour of studying was challenging. I started realising that there were many concepts that I needed to learn, and there was no time to slow down! I had to go fast, as I only had two days to study! Three hours later, I was in a café wondering if it made sense to continue studying. I continued a bit more until my brain could endure and went home.</p><p>The following day was even more complicated. Not necessarily the material, which I could not get properly, even a single thing with that feeling of rushing, but it was my head telling me that there was no chance to do well in that exam. There was frustration and a lot of negative self-talk. In the end, I didn’t even go to the exam. I gave up and failed without even trying.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was crushed...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If I had taken the time to simplify the concepts and go one step at a time, then that ball of complex facts I needed to know where we were coming from would not have been there in the first place. But I procrastinated. I waited until the end to study, deluding that that could be any good. Not only that, but I also failed three more subjects, passing only one out of five subjects that semester. That is quite devastating for a person who has never really failed any subject.</p><p>As I reflected on what happened, I thought I did not see things from the proper perspective or was not studying well. So then, I started learning how to do things better and more straightforwardly and be more productive while enjoying the study time. I attended courses and read all the books and articles that were crossing in front of my eyes.</p><p>Afterwards, I started getting really good scores, honours in some subjects, to finally obtain a Ph.D. in medical imaging, a career as a scientist in industry, as well as a second career as a Life Coach.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I made many mistakes...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, I designed this step by step course <strong>to skyrocket your studying skills</strong> with all this in mind. Not only that but also to lower your stress levels. In the beginning, it <strong>might feel strange</strong>. But, almost as if you are cheating, because<strong> you will feel less stressed, you will find yourself having more fun and accomplishing way more</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, I take you&nbsp; through the skills necessary to gain affinity in the five main concepts that will get you to mastery in your studies.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Clarity</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Energy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Information Quality</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Study Strategies</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Focus</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you master them all, you will be years ahead of your current version, and I want to witness that, so please do not forget to send me a message explaining how you achieved it! You are the reason this course exists!</p><p>Within the course, we will first start by looking at <strong>time management</strong>. Specifically, how to efficiently process the vast amount of information we receive daily. First, we will form the basis of a <strong>system </strong>that handles all the information. Then, we will talk about the importance of <strong>motivation, mood, nutrition, and exercise</strong>, <strong>the role they play in learning</strong>, and how to use them in our favour to enhance our learning capabilities. Then, we will learn a technique to create <strong>our study guide</strong>, a guide that will turn unstructured documentation into a highly customised learning highway. Effective use of time and recall is the following topic, where we will learn techniques to use time and recall efficiently the information we have previously known, as well as strategies as necessary as the use of <strong>spaced repetition</strong> with software like <strong>Anki</strong>. Last but not least, we will discuss <strong>focus</strong>, an essential aspect of learning to decrease study time while maximising <strong>productivity</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is some amazing feedback</strong></p><p>*****&nbsp; <strong>Ignacio Paz </strong>Agile Coach</p><p>This is a fantastic course that helps me to improve my time to get things done and adopt techniques to achieve my goals! </p><p><br></p><p>***** <strong>David Bofill </strong>Data Science Lead</p><p>Great content, easy to follow and understand. It gives a nice prespective on the subject. Totally recommended!</p><p><br></p><p>*****&nbsp; <strong>Marlene Hofer </strong>Teaching Enthusiast</p><p>I learned a lot in this course. I really found the information shared very useful and interesting. The newly acquired knowledge can be very easily and effectively applied to everyday situations when trying to learn as an adult. I highly recommend this course to anyone thinking on starting a new learning journey, and wants to do it stress-free.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About the author</strong></p><p>Marcel is an enthusiastic, fast learner. He likes to learn everything that makes him happy, even if that involves complicated matters. He firmly believes that complex things can be simplified into simple issues.</p><p>After +15 years of experience in continuous fast learning, he holds a bachelor’s in telecommunications engineering from UPC, Barcelona, and a masters in computer vision.

We do recommend spending time learning the full accounting process, and we do have courses that do just that.</strong></p><p><strong>However, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.</strong></p><p><strong>We will focus on bank feeds in this course.</strong></p><p><strong>For example, some small businesses may be perfectly happy using a cash basis system and will, therefore, not need some of the functions used in a full accounting cycle. Businesses that use a cash basis model can structure their data input to be much more heavily dependent on the bank and bank feed data.</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss types of businesses that fit well into a cash basis model as we work through the practice problems. We will also discuss some problem areas many businesses have and how to set up a system that works for them.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will work through a practice problem and will provide test data that learners can use in their system to follow along if they choose.</strong></p>",

Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future media presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your media presentation skills right now.

But how many of our respected personal relationships are marked by a lack of feeling? The best way to create those genuinely meaningful relationships we all want to have with our clients is to concentrate on making stories more personally resonant, situationally important, and emotionally intelligent. Greater empathy is the real key to every goal - we have (as content marketers, and as people).</p><p>Further speaking, we know that devising a content marketing strategy isn't very easy. It depends on numerous factors.&nbsp;First, the objective of the content has to be defined and the audience persona has to be created. Second, the headline or the title of the article should be captivating. Then, the content written has to be unique and the Call-to-Action (CTA) has to be super-actionable.&nbsp;Once all the above attributes are taken care of, the content article has to be marketed in the right target niche' platforms for viral growth. </p><p>We should also not forget that the written content should appeal to the reader's emotions. It should evoke a sense of these universally recognisable emotions being:</p><ul><li><p>Surprise</p></li><li><p>Amusement</p></li><li><p>Joy</p></li><li><p>Contentment</p></li></ul><p>Content marketing demands consistency, always. You can’t just throw a bunch of content on your website and expect it to generate traffic for the long run. If you create fresh content on a consistent basis, organic traffic will kick in from the search engines in due course of time. </p><p>Now, here's the thing. If you feel you know all the aspects of content marketing, the strategy, the process - then this beginners' quiz or practice test created by <strong>Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>and<strong> Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;Can you score well, here?
