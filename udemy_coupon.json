Dive right in and follow along with my lessons to see how easy it is to get started with pandas!</p><p>Whether you're a new data analyst or have spent years (*cough* too long *cough*) in Excel, <strong>Data Analysis with pandas and Python </strong>offers you an incredible introduction to one of the most powerful data toolkits available today!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Matplotlib </strong>is easy to use and an amazing visualizing library in Python.

Or our significant other made decisions on our behalf without asking our opinions. Or our pizza delivery person brought us cold pizza.&nbsp; But rather than address these issues, perhaps we let them slide. Sometimes \"letting things slide\" is the wisest decision to make. However, there are certainly other times where we need to stand up for ourselves and speak up about what we want, expect, or think is right. This can be uncomfortable for many people because they do not know how to walk the line between expressing their feelings and being contentious. Some people fear confrontation. Others simply speak too aggressively. Regardless, there is a way to assert oneself without causing conflict or discord.&nbsp; We discuss how to do so in this class.</p><p>In this course, we will discuss the following:</p><p>· <em>The difference between being assertive, passive, aggressive and passive-aggressive</em></p><p><em>· How positive affirmations can help change your mindset</em></p><p><em>· The role of body language</em></p><p><em>· How to use compromise and avoid escalation</em></p><p><em>· The Mary Poppins Method</em></p><p><em>· How to apply the Mary Poppins Method to express yourself more assertively</em></p>",

These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python collections module.</p><p>The collections module is used to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers. </p><p>The next section walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to use this Package.</p><p>In the next section, you’ll master all about math and statistics modules practically, and the functions that are used with them.</p><p>Simply, the math module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. and The statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.</p><p>Finally, In the last part of this course you will learn something very important, which is decoration.</p><p>In this section on decorators, we’ll look at what they are and how to create and use them in detail.</p><p>Simply and By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. that’s it . We will simplify this topic very without complication, and with practical examples to illustrate.<br></p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>XML and XSD: a complete W3C-content based course (+10 hours)</strong><br><em>The complete XML/XSD content from W3Schools, with much better explanations and practical examples w/ Eclipse IDE - 2019</em><br><br>\"<strong>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</strong> is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications - all of them free open standards - define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.\"<br><br>\"<strong>XSD</strong> (<strong>XML Schema Definition</strong>), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in. Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered \"valid\" according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document's validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation <em>infoset</em> can be useful in the development of XML document processing software.\"</p><p><br><strong>What you'll learn from this course:</strong><br><br>- You will learn all the theory about how to use XML language correctly, as well as all about its general and specific syntaxes, according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) official recommendations.</p><p>- You will learn all the practice about how to code your XML files, using the elements, attributes and types - default and custom ones - from the referred XSD schemas, as well as how to test the correctness and validation of your XML instances against their referred XSD docs using Eclipse IDE automation.</p><p>- You will adventure into the complete theory background about how to create your own XSD schema documents and master the details about XSD general and specific syntaxes, according to W3C official specifications.</p><p>- You will practice, through tens of examples, how to code your own XSD files, using the 3 design methods suggested by W3C, as well as how to take advantage of all main base elements, attributes and types (default W3C library/namespace) to create your own personalized XML/XSD components.</p><p>- You will have pretty clear what default and custom namespaces are, as well as prefixes, both at the XML instances as at the XSD documents. You'll learn how to import and include multiple XSD documents into one same XSD and also how to refer to multiple XSD documents from one same XML instance, nice and easy... even using your own personal brand as the prefix for customizing your code (in my case: danielpm1982).</p><p>- All this course's theory, as well as the good practices and techniques used, are based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and W3Schools contents, here with much better and complete explanations and practical examples.</p><p>- After doing this course, you'll understand much easier all the document types used at Web Services development, or any other application that uses XML and XSD (or WSDL).</p><p>- All source codes are available at my GitHub, as well as attached to each practice lecture, as a zip file. You can easily download, study, reuse and test them yourself, for learning purposes, and even create much better examples. This is how you learn: starting from the basics and evolving, through practicing, until proficiency. All at your own pace and time and re-watching any lecture as many times as you want.</p><p>- Additional content, as WSDL and JSON theory and practical lectures, as well as lectures with sample Web Services projects, demonstrating the real world applicability of XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON, will be added incrementally within the next months, at this same course. But you can finish this course with the current content, as it is, and receive your Udemy Certification on that… and if you want, you may return later, watch the future extra content lectures (WSDL and JSON) and, at the end, receive another Udemy Certification with the updated content and course name. All students will be notified when any future content is added.</p><p>- This course is already composed of more than 10 hours, a workload greater than almost all other same-topic courses at Udemy.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><br><br>- If you wanna practice, you should have Eclipse IDE installed on your PC or notebook. But you can just watch the theory and practical lectures, at any device with internet access, in case you have no computer available at that moment.</p><p>- No programming languages or frameworks are required for this course.</p><p>- No silly or useless tests will be imposed onto you. You will know you got the content right when you implement your own code and test it successfully, as done at our practical lectures. Simple as that and with no pressure!<br><br><strong>Whom this course is for ?</strong><br><br>- Any human being who wishes to learn XML and XSD for future use in any of their many market applications, specially at, but not limited to, Web Services development.<br><br><strong>What are the references of this course ?</strong><br><br>- The main reference source is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is the creator and worldwide maintainer of the specifications (REC) of XML language and related technologies (XSD, WSDL, etc). All related links, with W3C content, are attached to each theory lecture description.<br><br><strong>What's the difference between taking this course and simply viewing W3Schools material at their own site ?<br><br></strong>Although the content is almost entirely referenced on W3C publications, this course offers much better, organized and understandable explanations about the content, and also a much greater set of examples, using Eclipse IDE, from the easiest to the most complex ones. At W3Schools site, for instance, you only find very simple snippets of code.<br><br><strong>What's the difference between taking this course and the other XML/XSD courses at Udemy ?<br><br></strong>- No objection at all to those who may take more than one course. But this one has an innovative methodology, is more organized and complete (over 10 hours of theory and practices already), as well as it has much better examples, explained step by step, without any hurried 2-3 min lectures. It covers IN FULL everything that W3C suggests about XML and XSD.</p><p>- This course is organized similar to university or college lectures, with an average of 1h per lecture. The organization is oriented towards the content itself and not short time limited lectures. I think prioritizing the content on the curriculum organization contributes way better to cohesiveness as well as to the organization and consolidation of the content in anyone's brain. 2-3 min classes end up being a big confusion resulted from a too high fragmentation level of the content. Students always criticize on other courses that everything's too hastily delivered, as if the students already knew the subjects. Here, and differently from that, you'll see it's all nicely and easily delivered, and you won't get lost on the content, even if you never heard about XML or any structural or programming language before. You're free, though, to plan your own individual learning schedule. Just take note of the subject you last saw, and then continue from there when you want.</p><p>- Finally, this course is divided into Theory and Practice lectures. You'll, thus, have multiple chances, from multiple explanation perspectives, to learn or complement the acknowledging of each topic, subtopics, practices, and so on. And, of course, at your own time, pace and individual needs. The access to this course will be forever yours (it doesn't expire) and you'll be able to review any lecture as much as you want. A big advantage of e-learning recorded lectures compared to live face-to-face attendance lectures.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Welcome to the course !!

LAMP is an acronym for a popular group of software packages used to deliver high-performance web applications. LAMP is most commonly used to denote Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. However, MySQL and PHP are often swapped for alternative software solutions such as MariaDB, and Python. <br><br>The course starts with a detailed overview on setting up and configuring an instance remotely using terminal and terminal emulators such as PuTTY. Here, students learn the foundations of Linux and various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu to securely power web servers. Students will learn various Linux maintenance and directory commands, coupled with user account configuration and disabling root user access. From there, we dive into the foundations of database management systems and explore the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. We also explore the two main database transaction standards, including ACID and CAP theorem. <br><br>Once students have a solid understand on the foundations of cloud computing, we demonstrate how to securely install and configure LAMP Stack on Ubuntu. The installation will be complete with MariaDB and PHP, whereby students will learn to execute database commands directly from server-side PHP scripts. The course concludes with an entire section devoted to PHP development, where we explore just about every aspect of PHP syntax to code dynamic web content.</p><p>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground and we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let’s get started.</p>",

      "description": "<p>This course offers a comprehensive guide for aspiring cloud practitioners interested in learning the complete lifecycle of virtual instance deployment and configuration on popular cloud platforms like AWS and Linode. The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. <br><br>The second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we’ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground and we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let’s get started.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p><p>· <strong>Network security</strong> is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</p><p>· <strong>Application security</strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.</p><p>· <strong>Information security</strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</p><p>· <strong>Operational security</strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</p><p>· <strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity</strong> define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.</p><p><strong>End-user education</strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</p>",

It streamlines security related business processes to ensure minimal variations and also offers consistency in the implementation of security controls. Guidance in decision making is provided by policies, and standards are used to indicate expected user behaviour. Recommendations on implementing security processes is part of guidelines which are optional in nature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Which of the following is a possible oversight which can happen with job rotation?</strong></p><p><strong><em>a) Privilege creep</em></strong></p><p>b) Lack of separation of duties</p><p>c) Collusion</p><p>d) All of the above</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Privilege creep occurs when an employee accumulates access and privileges across job rotations because their privileges are not periodically reviewed and updated. They accumulate privileges which they don’t even need but still possess. Lack of separation of duties may compromise security but is not related to job rotation. Similarly, collusion can occur regardless of job rotation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Which of the following BEST describes exposure?</strong></p><p>a) A flaw or weakness of an asset or a safeguard</p><p>b) Damage, loss or disclosure of an asset</p><p>c) An illegal act </p><p><strong><em>d) A weakness or vulnerability that can cause a security breach</em></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Exposure refers to a weakness or vulnerability that can cause a security breach i.e. the adverse event has not actually occurred, but it is an estimation of the adverse consequences of such an event. A flaw or weakness of the asset or the safeguard is called a vulnerability and if a threat has already been realized then it is called experienced exposure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. A notice placed on the common room wall about the usage conditions of Wi-Fi is a ______ access control?</strong></p><p>a)&nbsp;Preventive</p><p>b) Corrective</p><p>c)&nbsp;Compensating</p><p><strong><em>d) Driective</em></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>This is an example of a directive access control. Directive access control mechanisms aim at directing subjects to a certain behaviour or to limit their actions. Preventive access control refers to prevent the unwanted activity from happening in the first place. Corrective access controls aim to return the system state to normalcy or correct a damaged system after an incident. Compensating access control provide additional security to address weakness in an existing security control.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Which of the following is true about private key cryptography?</strong></p><p>a) It is scalable</p><p><strong><em>b) It is faster than public key cryptography</em></strong></p><p>c) It offers nonrepudiation</p><p>d) Different keys are used for encryption and decryption</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Private key (or symmetric key) cryptography is significantly fast compared to public key cryptography because of the nature of mathematics involved and because it uses the same algorithm for encryption and decryption. However, it is not scalable as different pairs of users need to generate keys for their communication, leading to a large number of keys. Moreover, it does not offer nonrepudiation since the same key is used by different users for encryption and decryption.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6. Which of the following models employs sensitivity labels such as top secret and secret?</strong></p><p>a) RBAC</p><p>b)&nbsp;DAC</p><p><strong><em>c)&nbsp;MAC</em></strong></p><p>d)&nbsp;Rule Based Access Control</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>MAC (Mandatory Access Control) implements access controls based on the clearances of subjects and the labels assigned to objects. RBAC (Role-based Access Control) assigns permissions to subjects based on the role that has been assigned to them in the organization. DAC (Discretionary Access Control) is a more flexible model which allows subjects which have ownership over objects to share them with other subjects. Rule based Access Control assigns permissions based on a pre-defined list of rules.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>7. A digital certificate endorsed by a CA contains the issuer name, public key of david.cooper@itpro.com as well as the serial number, period of validity and the signature algorithm used. Which of the following is NOT true about this certificate?</strong></p><p>a) It is only valid as long as the validity period mentioned</p><p>b)&nbsp;The subject’s public key can now be used by the general public to decrypt messages</p><p><strong><em>c)&nbsp;It certifies that David Cooper is the subject</em></strong></p><p>d) The signature algorithm mentioned must be used to decrypt the public key</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All of the above statements regarding this particular certificate are true except for the claim that it certifies the subject David Cooper. This is not true because the certificate just certifies the email address david.cooper@itpro.com and not the actual user David Cooper. Technically, this email could belong to John Doe since the certificate does not explicitly certify that fact.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>8. Which of the following is a MORE serious concern for biometric authentication systems?</strong></p><p><strong><em>a)&nbsp;False positives</em></strong></p><p>b)&nbsp;False negatives</p><p>c) True positive</p><p>d) True negative</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>False positives in biometric authentication system are a far greater concern than the others. A false positive means that the system has (wrongly) authenticated an individual as being someone else and this can lead to a compromise of the security of the system. False negatives may cause some delay as an authentic individual is wrongly rejected by the system, but it is not as serious as a false positive. True positives and negatives are desired traits of a system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>9. An organization wants to test a software but does not have access to its source code. Which of the following is NOT a valid type of testing?</strong></p><p>a) DAST</p><p>b)&nbsp;Blackbox</p><p>c) Fuzzing</p><p><strong><em>d) SAST</em></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All of the above can be used since they do not require the source code, except for SAST. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) involves testing the application without running it, by performing a static analysis of the source code to identify vulnerabilities. DAST identifies vulnerableness in an application by executing it and providing malicious input. Fuzzing is a testing technique in which different variations of the input are tried to identify weaknesses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>10. Demonstrating to someone that you know the password to a lock without sharing it with that person is an example of?</strong></p><p>a) Split-knowledge</p><p><strong><em>b) Zero-knowledge proof</em></strong></p><p>c) Work function</p><p>d) Secure proofing</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A Zero-knowledge proof involves proving to someone that you know a passcode without actually revealing it. Split knowledge is a concept in which a passcode is split among multiple people such that all of them need to work together to authenticate. Work function is a measure of the amount of work required to break a cipher. Secure proofing is not a valid concept.</p>",

There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Cloud computing allows you to store and access data and programs in the virtual platform instead of your computer's hard drive. Cloud management makes it possible to track and allocate the company's expenses in cloud computing, generate reports, and predict future loads. Thus, it provides accurate cost management, forecasting, and reporting. Cloud computing can be accessed from anywhere and anytime. Cloud computing services are being adopted widely across a variety of organizations and in many domains. Simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility.</p><p>Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, use them to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications that run on these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions.</p><p>In this master course of cloud management is on-line course and we plan to give students an overview of the field of Cloud Computing, Cloud Management and an in-depth study into its enabling technologies and main building blocks. Students will gain hands-on experience solving relevant problems through projects that will utilize existing public cloud tools. It is our objective that students will develop the skills needed to become a practitioner or carry out research projects in this domain.</p><p>Students will learn how virtualization can allow software and hardware images (e.g., virtual machines) to run side-by-side on a single cloud data center while provided security, resource and failure isolations. They will understand how virtualization enables clouds to offer software, computation, and storage as services as well as attain agility and elasticity properties.

The key principle of the RAD process is a reduction in planning to focus on a highly iterative design and construction process, enabling teams to accomplish more in less time, without impacting client satisfaction. Apart from a shorter time-to-market, one of the most significant advantages of RAD is client involvement. RAD emphasizes incremental and iterative delivery of functioning models to the client instead of following a rigid process model like the traditional SDLC. Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements. Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD. Requires highly skilled developers/designers. High dependency on modeling skills. Only suitable for scalable, component-based systems – RAD is best used for large systems with multiple components. This is because, using RAD, many pre-developed components will be used, and it's not cost-effective to create a single component or piece of software for a smaller company.</p><p>In this specialised master course you can learn the specialized topics of:</p><p>1.

That’s not true. The basics of SEO are actually quite simple. And with 58% of all web traffic coming from Google, it’s certainly something worth learning about if you have a website. If you think the SEO fundamentals aren’t enough to get you ranked, think again. Most people running websites have a very limited understanding of SEO, so knowing the fundamentals can certainly help you succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the Benefits of SEO?</strong></p><ul><li><p>SEO leads to more traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to consistent traffic</p></li><li><p>SEO leads to ‘free’ traffic</p></li></ul><p><strong>SEO Helps You to Rank Higher</strong></p><p>But you can’t rank higher if Google doesn’t even know your website exists in the first place. Getting your website indexed by search engines means you’re in the race, not that you’re likely to win. That’s where SEO comes in. SEO is an ongoing process that, if done well, increases your chances of winning over time. It’s much easier to do SEO well when your website is properly set up for SEO success.</p><p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business. And that content needs to reach audience members in a way that feels natural and organic versus being disruptive. Content marketing helps businesses do this, and it describes the process of attracting, engaging with, and delighting your target markets.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Has Become One of the Most In-demand Skills of 2023</strong></p><p>In fact, copywriting jobs can pay upwards of $100k per year. Why? Every business can benefit from someone who writes great copy. From startups to Fortune 500s and everything in between, copywriting can make or break the success of an organisation.</p><p>The truth of the matter is this; anyone can become a copywriter. You don’t need a degree or specialised training to master this skill. So, whether you’re looking to start a career as a freelance copywriter or just want to improve the copy for your own business, this guide will give you the blueprint for getting your feet wet with copywriting.</p><p>Copywriting is the art of writing text for marketing purposes. It’s designed to sell your products or services while establishing a voice for your brand. The main intention of copywriting is to persuade people to take a particular action, whether it’s purchasing, signing up for something, or any other type of conversion.</p><p><strong>Copywriting Comes in Many Different Forms: </strong></p><p>Advertisements, web pages, brochures, white papers, social media content, and company tag-lines would all fall into the copywriting category, and that’s just barely scratching the surface.</p><p>But copywriting is much more than just words. Great copy tells a compelling story and represents your brand image. It pulls on the strings that trigger the decision-making process for whoever reads what you’re writing. </p><p>Copywriting doesn’t sell products or services; it sells emotion and lifestyle. According to Google Trends, the global interest in copywriting is currently at an all-time high, based on search data over the last ten years.</p><p><strong>When You Enrol, You Also Get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course materials and tuition worth at least $1.080 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and free extra resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Quizzes - 472 Questions A, B, C, D &amp; 14 Assignments</p></li><li><p>Complete Overview of all 210&nbsp;Google SEO Ranking Factors</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 lessons to quit your job and become a digital nomad</p></li><li><p>PDF 10 reasons to become a digital nomad today</p></li><li><p>PDF Digital Nomad Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Starter pack for digital nomads</p></li><li><p>PDF 157 questions that will help you raise your prices dramatically</p></li><li><p>PDF Ebook-Side Hustle Secrets</p></li><li><p>PDF Create a photography landing page that turns visitors in to clients</p></li><li><p>PDF Find photography clients before travelling to your next destination</p></li><li><p>PDF Presentation template: Attracting high value clients whilst travelling</p></li><li><p>PDF Pricing Strategies and Adding Value</p></li></ul><p><strong>Start Your Journey to Google SEO &amp; Copywriting Today!</strong></p><p>Digital marketing can turn around your entire financial situation - <em>if </em>you know how to do it right.

These responses are insufficient. Action is always quicker than reaction and these methods of traditional security consistently give the violent criminal the upper hand. Even the skilled self-defense or security practitioner is left at the mercy of an attacker. The average citizen is just waiting around ready to be victimized. The criminal has all of the control. However, there is an answer. There is a way to take control, to be empowered to stop violence and crime before it ever starts. The world of espionage offers us several techniques to be proactive and take control over our security and the protection of those we love. This covert world is more dangerous than the world most of us live in. It’s a world where overlooked vulnerabilities can have deadly consequences. Learn the espionage and counter-espionage skills that intelligence operatives use to survive in some of the most dangerous environments on earth.

      "description": "<p>Master course in Leadership, How is Leadership Defined?</p><p>There are many definitions of leadership. Many lines have been written attempting to capture the essence in just a few words.</p><p>The Oxford English Dictionary definition of leadership is simply:</p><ul><li><p>\"<em>The action of leading a group of people or an organisation, or the ability to do this </em>.\"</p></li></ul><p>We need now to define 'lead' in this context, which is more helpful with regards to appreciating the breadth and depth of the word 'leadership'. Here are the most relevant points from the dictionary:</p><ul><li><p>Be in charge or command</p></li><li><p>Organise and direct</p></li><li><p>Set a process in motion</p></li><li><p>Be a reason or motive for (others to act, change, etc.)</p></li></ul><p>Note that only the first point strongly implies that leadership depends on a single leader, and even this point may easily be interpreted to mean that it can be achieved by delegated responsibility, even across a number of levels and on a vast scale.</p><p>Also consider that the last two points do not restrict leadership to the leading of an organised group of people such as a business or other provider of services/products, etc. The last two points broaden the scope to anyone or any collective of people, who inspire or motivate other people to act in some way towards some sort of aim or task or outcome.</p><p>Effective leadership requires collaboration between the leaders and the followers. There are times that leadership will demand a lot from the followers. But leaders should know the best way to bring out the best from people.</p><p>Self-leadership : All leadership, however, should begin with oneself. Any person who wants to be a leader needs to have a great degree of discipline. Leaders are also committed to learning and self-improvement. Warren Bennis effectively outlined effective leadership, which consists of five key practices and principles.</p><p>First, know yourself.</p><p>Have a vision.</p><p>Communicate the vision.</p><p>Build trust.</p><p>Take effective action.</p><p>In this master course, you can learn 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction and importance of leadership</p><p>2. Leadership behaviour, traits, skills, and abilities</p><p>3. Styles of leadership</p><p>4. Leadership in Business</p><p>5.

It is done for the purpose of planning the budget and evaluating productivity. It is helpful for administrators to assess which goods, units, or programs are most efficient and which ones require enhancement.</em></p><p><em>Cost management includes assessing expenses that are fixed and adjustable. Fixed costs are losses that recur each month regardless of the manufacturing rate. Types cover leasing, depreciation, loan interest, and rental charges. Dynamic costs are expenditures that fluctuate with shifts in the level of production, such as costs of inventory, labour, and maintenance. Such costs are related to manufacturing in that the higher the units of a product produced, the greater the price associated with the materials and labour involved in the production of the item</em>.</p><p>This incredible course focusing on&nbsp;<strong><em>\"Cost Accounting and Artificial Intelligence Tools\"</em></strong> created by Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Practicing Cost and Management Accountant \"Ravi Pacha\" covers the following aspects of cost accounting which include: The meaning of cost accounting, various branches of cost accounting, functions of cost accounting, classification of cost, etc. Furthermore, we will walk you through some mind-blowing tools that leverage Artificial Intelligence in the field of Accounting to automate the complete accounting processes. While digital technology has evolved over the years, we've switched from tv to the Internet, and we're integrating Artificial Intelligence seamlessly and slowly today. John McCarthy coined the term AI for the first time in 1956. It involves many of the main things that range from robotics process automation to the actual robotics process. Because of the amount of data these types of organizations are working with, it has become highly popular with large companies today. Increasing demand for information pattern awareness has contributed to growth in the AI market. AI models are much more successful at detecting information trends than people, which help companies understand and gain insight into their target audience. Thousands of businesses around the world see AI as the next big thing for the finance industry. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can be used widely for financial transaction auditing systems. AI can also be a great help when it comes to processing a large number of pages for tax changes. Organizations dependent on AI can be expected to make major firm-related decisions in the near future. AI also has the ability to identify how consumers should respond to different circumstances and problems. Artificial Intelligence can help people and businesses make smarter choices at a very fast pace. But the key here is to find the right human-machine balance.</p><p>Get ready to go wow.

      "description": "<p><strong><em>Someone said that the Future of Social Media is \"All Talk\" and nothing more - way back in the year 2016 - believe it or not!&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>He or she who thought about this true fact is absolutely right.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>Audio-based social media stepped up to the plate in response to a pandemic-induced demand for genuine connection while avoiding screen weariness this year. Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising — a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now. Let's start booming.</p>",

We will also discuss some reasons why the software may be offered for free and look over Personal Capital data security.</p><p>We will compare the Personal Capital software to other types of software that can connect directly to financial institutions and pull financial information, such software generally falling into the category of accounting software that uses the double-entry accounting system or financial management software.</p><p>Accounting software using the double-entry accounting system includes packages such as QuickBooks, Xero, &amp; Wave accounting. Although accounting software utilizes financial institution connectivity it generally does so differently than Personal Capital software, which falls into the financial management category. We will discuss the differences in software.</p><p>Other financial management and budgeting software include Quicken, Mint, and Microsoft Excel, Excel actually having a template called Money in Excel that has financial institution connectivity.</p><p>Learners will practice converting financial data into an income statement by downloading transactions from financial institutions, categorizing them, and then exporting them into Excel for sorting. We will compare the process with what would be done using accounting software like QuickBooks.</p><p>The course will discuss the benefits of the personal net worth or balance sheet functionality of Personal Capital software, the software pulling in assets and liability balances automatically for items such as bank accounts, investment accounts like 401(K), savings accounts, CD accounts, credit card balances, mortgage balances, and loan balances.</p><p>We will also discuss the benefit of the software providing more detail on our investment holdings and providing insights and suggestions to improve returns and reduce risk. The ability to pull investments into one place allows a more rounded analysis of the data than you may get from one brokerage account analyzed in isolation.</p><p>Learners will be able to use the projection planner to help plan for retirement and other large investment items. The Personal Capital software utilizes sophisticated analytical tools including a Monte Carlo Simulation tool.</p><p>We will also explore the home appraisal tool offered by the software and we will practice adding non-financial institution assets and liabilities, making our net worth or balance sheet completer and more accurate.</p>",

      "heading": "Explore Highly-Futuristic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies that will redefine the world of technology forever",
      "description": "<p>Let's get this straight and to the point.</p><p><em>Man has long feared the rise of the machine, fearing that his own creation might become really smarter or intelligent and more sophisticated than he is. However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text. This video is a total highlight in <strong>Digishock 3.0</strong>. </p><p><strong><em>Enrol now in the course.&nbsp;A&nbsp;mind-blowing educative experience is promised for all learners.</em></strong></p><p>Let's start learning about the upcoming new&nbsp;futuristic technologies that are based on Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>There is no time to wait. </p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!&nbsp;</p><p>The most awaited \"<strong><em>Digishock 3.0\" </em></strong><em>course</em> is finally here.</p>",

From there we explore the import dialog, import file handling, file renaming, and metadata presets. These are all instrumental building blocks when it comes to building proficiency in navigating the Lightroom workspace. Once we’ve explored the foundations, we transition over to exploring the map module. Here we explore navigating the map module, with an overview of its use cases. From there we dive into geotagging both single photos and collection sets. Students also learn to filter images by location and use saved locations for enhanced sorting and tagging.<br><br>After completion of the map module, we transition to the book module. Here students will learn to create stunning, customized photo books using their image collections. We start with demonstrating how to navigate the book module interface. From there we explore book settings and layout options. This includes customized pages, page numbers, cell padding, and text formatting. We also cover background effects, before concluding with book publication using both third party services, or simply saving as PDF or JPEG files.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off with Lightroom.

Learn how to design a poster that will grab attention and drive viewers to your film.</p><p>Poster design is an important aspect of marketing for any film, but it is especially important for independent films. This is because independent films often have smaller budgets for marketing and must rely on effective, eye-catching posters to grab the attention of potential viewers.</p><p>A good poster can help to establish the tone and theme of a film, and can also serve to introduce the main characters and key plot points. In addition, a well-designed poster can help to build buzz and excitement around a film, leading to increased ticket sales and word-of-mouth promotion.</p><p>For independent films, which may not have the same level of visibility as major studio releases, a strong poster can be an essential tool for attracting an audience and generating interest. Even if a film has a limited theatrical release, a good poster can help to create a lasting impression and drive online engagement and social media activity, which can further help to promote the film and increase its reach.</p>",

We will emphasize when a modified accrual method will be used, and what the differences in recording financial transactions will be when used, as compared to an accrual method.</strong></p><p><strong>We will record transactions related to revenue in both the General Fund and at the government-wide activities level.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss tax anticipation notes and how they will be recorded under a modified accrual method.</strong></p><p><strong>Learners and instructor will explore many examples of the closing process, closing out temporary accounts. We will compare the closing process for governmental entities to the closing process in for-profit accounting.</strong></p><p><strong>We will examine how to create subsidiary ledgers related to revenue, estimated revenue, appropriations, encumbrances, and expenditures.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will provide examples of recording supplies using the consumption method and purchases method, explaining the differences between the two.</strong></p>",

      "description": "<p>Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.</p><p>The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.</p><p>We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor’s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company’s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1. Describe what an audit engagement is and the objectives of the audit engagement</p><p>2.

      "description": "<p>There is a strong need to have positive dialogue during any conflict in and out as well as in dilemma. “The existence of activists on the issue who are ‘tired of talking,’ who consequently don’t participate in the dialogue, but who subsequently resist action ideas generated in the deliberation.”</p><p><br></p><p>This dilemma rings very true to me. Depending on the topic, I can be very tired of talking, and feel high levels of frustration and cynicism when the talk does not lead anywhere aside from a report in a desk drawer or in an attached document deep in an inbox. Even more frustrating is the realization that the talk was heard by folks who had already made up their minds about what needed to be done. This frustration has definitely led to occasional reticence to participate, and suspicion of the ideas generated in such discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>Healthy dialogue is extremely important to strengthen and expand cooperation in the community and one of the main ways of resolving conflicts is communication between people. This is the most common method and includes talks.</p><p><br></p><p>It is important to prepare a suitable environment for dialogue; while dialogue is often confused with other forms of discourse, it belongs in a distinctive category of its own; it doesn't involve arguing for a point of view, as debates, it's not a method of reaching agreement or taking decisions as negotiation, it does not only emerge when participants trust and respect each other, interrupt their judgments, and listen to all points of view, as discussions. So it is important to find a mutual or common ground between the parties in the community, for example, talking about exciting things for both sides, and should be carried out with a focus on a win-win solution. The methods of dialogue involve the interaction of collective individuals; in daily life, conflicts can be resolved through dialogue and various types of communication. And to ensure that positive results of such activities are achieved; must be achieved. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>First</strong>, to ensure objective consideration of controversial issues;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Second</strong>, free discussion of all the positions and points of view in the presence of equal opportunities to participate in the discussion of each subject;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Third</strong>, design and discuss the results in the form of recommendations, summarizing reveal the identity of views and positions on other issues. Throughout the community dialogue, a variety of activities will be used to foster community collaboration. These activities will engage stakeholders/partners at all levels, break down silos, drive innovation, and institute partnerships and collaboration among a variety of community stakeholders to work together to define a unanimous project scope, roles, and responsibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>The aim of the dialogue is to share information, find mutual thoughts, and recognize existing links between different relations and various extents of cooperation. The dialogue should be smoothly flexible, according to the context, and conducted within the structure, in the appropriate format and level, including regional, sub-regional or national levels, regional and sub-regional organizations, as well as representatives of NGOs, should be bound by this dialogue in order to achieve the good well in the community first and then to create a good nation-state. Good governance should strengthen the internal and external ties of the Parties and make a fundamental constituent of this dialogue. Finally, the expansion of social dialogue and covering most socioeconomic problems is a sign of the prevailing model of social partnership; because over time the practice of social dialogue will overcome limits; resolve purely people relations and conflicts.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>The most <strong>important</strong> goal of a <strong>follow</strong>-<strong>up</strong> call is to secure a sale. ... Besides additional <strong>sales</strong>, a good relationship and trust gained from <strong>follow</strong>-<strong>up</strong> calls you've made will encourage consumers to purchase from you again. And if you've done a really good job with <strong>follow</strong>-<strong>up</strong> calls—they may just refer some new business your way.</p><p>Networking is both a Science and an Art. In this Networking Series, I’m going to cover the science of networking including the different types of networking groups, the different type of networking formats, and what to look for in networking groups. I’m also going to cover the Art of Networking so you can choose the right groups to spend your precious time at, build long-lasting relationships, and maximize your impact in your ever growing sphere of influence.</p><p>This course is for you if</p><ol><li><p>You just got a job or started a business and need to expand your sphere of influence.</p></li><li><p>You’re in a new position that requires you to meet new people in order to get new business.</p></li><li><p>You’re tired of spending all your time going to networking events without getting any results or you’re tired of dealing with people who just want to sell you things.</p></li><li><p>You want to get better at building long-lasting, solid relationships and a long-lasting referral business.</p></li></ol><p>In this training on Networking, we’re going to cover the power of follow-ups. As someone once said, “The gold is in the follow-up.” We’ll discuss some follow-up strategies and techniques you can use to maximize your business and help you find quality business partners to work with.</p><p>According to a study done by the Association of Sales Executives, <strong>81% of all sales happen on or after the fifth contact. </strong>Years ago, IBM did a study that said that sales occur after 7 contacts. If all you do is go to networking events and pass out business cards and then “HOPE” the business will come flooding in, you’re in for a big surprise.</p><p>Following-up with people, contacts, prospects should be a part of every business strategy if you want to maximize your success. Before you can establish a follow-up strategy though, you have to determine who you’re following up with.</p><p>There’s another saying out there that goes something like, “People like to do business with people they know, like, and trust.” Of course, this also plays into the 5 or 7 contacts I just mentioned above. And to take it a step further, if they feel like YOU know THEM, then that’s where the magic happens.</p><p>If you can convince them that you know their situation, you know their challenges, and you can fix it, then they’ll want to work with you. Therefore; it’s important that you have a different message for different people. We call this segmentation. </p><p>Humans are social animals. Scientists have demonstrated that interaction with other people improves our mental health . Business is also dependent on social interactions. We all need each other for nearly everything. Every time, the \"Pay it Forward” strategy works. Give before you get. It is better to help people now than later.</p><p>Networking is a way to foster teamwork. Working with friends or colleagues in business, sport, or non-profit organizations allows us to accomplish more. Collaboration helps us solve large problems that require different expertise. According to an African proverb, \"If you want speed, go alone. If you want to get far, go with your friends.\" Working with people builds trust and respect. We can leverage our expertise, experience, and networks by working together more intensively and for longer periods of time.</p><p><strong>Bonus:&nbsp;Each lecture comes with a downloadable MP3 version so you can take us in your car, to the gym, while walking the dog and revisit all the valuable lessons in this course!</strong></p>",

      "description": "<p>Master course in Advanced SEO is simply any set of SEO techniques that require some degree of expert knowledge. It varies from person to person, but let's just say you probably won't master these in your first few months.</p><p>Advanced SEO typically involves technical concepts that are somewhat advanced, and/or a deeper understanding of the workings of Google's algorithm and are often employed by Professional SEOs. Anyone can master advanced concepts with the right strategic guidance and real life application.</p><p>According to Griffin, Search engine optimization is the science of improving a website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services. The more visibility a website has on search engines, the more likely it is that brand captures business.</p><p>Website visibility is commonly measured by the placement -- or ranking -- of the site on search engine results pages (SERPs). And companies always vie for the first page, where they are most likely to garner the most attention.</p><p>Using Google as an example, SERPs often feature ads at the top of the page. These are positions that businesses are willing to pay for to ensure placement on that first page. Following ads are the regular search listings, which marketers and search engines refer to as organic search results. The SEO process aims to increase a business's organic search results, driving organic search traffic to the site. This enables data marketers to distinguish between traffic that comes to a website from other channels -- such as paid search, social media, referrals and direct -- and the organic search traffic.</p><p>Organic search traffic is usually higher-quality traffic because users are actively searching for a specific topic, product or service for which a site might rank. If a user finds that site through the search engine, it can lead to better brand engagement.</p><p>How does SEO work? While there is a way to maximize results, it is almost impossible to fully manipulate search algorithms. Businesses often look to the shortest path toward ideal results with the least amount of effort, but SEO requires a lot of action and time. There is no SEO strategy where something can be changed today with the expectation of clear results tomorrow. SEO is a long-term project, with daily action and constant activity.</p><p>Search engines use bots to crawl all website pages, downloading and storing that information into a collection known as an index. This index is like a library and when someone searches for something in it, the search engine acts as the librarian. The search engine pulls and displays relevant information from the search query and shows users content related to what they were looking for. Search engine algorithms analyze webpages in the index to determine the order those pages should be displayed on the SERP.</p><p>In this master course, you can learn about 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction of Web 3.0 and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) </p><p>2. Types of SEO and SEO tools</p><p>3. Importance of Local SEO</p><p>4. SEO strategies to generate website traffic </p><p>5. SEO and SEM in digital marketing</p>",

This one-chapter book of the Bible is packed with daily living truth as it explores the lives of 3 men in the early church:</p><p>- Gaius</p><p>- Diotrephes</p><p>- Demetrius</p><p>It is my opinion that the objective of the writer is to ensure we mirror only good examples and identify errors today. The truth explored is so vivid!

      "description": "<p>This course will walk through a comprehensive accounting problem using Microsoft Excel in a step-by-step process. You may also use another spreadsheet software like Google Sheets.</p><p>Learners will learn how to navigate Microsoft Excel as well as how to create a well-designed accounting worksheet, complete with a general journal, trial balance, general ledger, subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable, accounts payable, &amp; inventory, financial statements and much more.</p><p>Excel is a very good tool to learn accounting because it is much more transparent than a database program, like accounting software, QuickBooks being a common example of accounting software.</p><p>As we enter transactions into our Microsoft Excel worksheet, we will discuss how the data input would commonly be entered into accounting software like QuickBooks and what data input forms would normally drive the transactions.</p><p>The course will start out from a blank Excel Worksheet. We will build the outline for our accounting system from the blank spreadsheet.</p><p>For each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps being completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.</p><p>Therefore, you can complete the entire problem starting from one blank spreadsheet, or you can jump forward in the problem and rework any component of the problem by downloading the related worksheet at that point in the process.</p><p>After constructing the outline of our accounting worksheet, the first section will discuss the most common accounting transactions and the data input form often used in accounting software, like QuickBooks, to enter them, common data input forms including invoice, bill, deposit. . .</p><p>We will then start our comprehensive problem, constructing a new Excel worksheet and entering beginning balances into it, imagining that we had a prior accounting system which we are now converting to our new accounting system in Excel.</p><p>We will then enter two-months worth of data input. When entering the accounting data we will create the journal entry, post it to the trial balance, giving us a good look at which accounts are impacted, post to the general ledger, and make adjustments to any subsidiary ledgers needed. </p><p>We will also update the financial statements periodically.</p><p>For the second month of operations, we create a bit more complex trial balance, allowing us to calculate both the year-to-date numbers, including both months of data input, and the current period numbers, showing income statement accounts for just the second month of operations.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, we will process two bank reconciliations, using mock bank statements. As we construct our bank reconciliations, we will discuss how accounting software often accomplishes this task.</p><p>Next, we will adjust our worksheet to enter period end adjusting journal entries as well as reversing entries. For each adjusting entry we will consider the reasons for it and how to set up the accounting system so that our adjusting entries do not mess up the data input process in the accounting department.</p><p>After entering the adjusting entries we will construct our financial statements.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The United Nations Charter notes that the United Nations was founded to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” Tragically, there have been over 250 armed conflicts since the Charter was signed in 1946. Sustainable Development Goal 16: Promote Just, Peaceful, and Inclusive Societies, calls for all Member States to promote peaceful co-existence among people. Some of its primary targets include reducing arms flows and combatting organized crime, as well as significantly reducing all forms of violence worldwide.</p><p>Today more than 600 million young people live in volatile and conflict-prone areas. Young people are disproportionately affected by the multiple and often interlinked forms of violence such as political violence, organized crime and terrorist attacks which exact human, social and economic costs. In the past decade, the recruitment of young people into violent and extremist groups has led some to view youth as a threat to global security and stability. However, research shows that the number of young people who actively participate in violence is a small minority, while the vast majority of youth are not prone to violence, despite the injustices, deprivations and abuse they can confront daily, particularly in conflict zones. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that they can and do play active roles as agents of positive and constructive change, and the recently adopted Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security highlights this fact. It is a formal recognition of the positive role youth can play in the maintenance of international peace and security.</p><p>The maintenance of global peace and security is a cross cutting issue that is critical to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. Several UN offices are involved in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security including: the Security Council, General Assembly, Secretary-General, Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support and Political Affairs and the Peacebuilding Support Office. Universities and institutions of higher learning are also important actors because they educate future leaders and peacemakers, who will shape the course of peace building in the world.</p><p><br></p>",

He also pushed for more aid to help struggling renters and homeowners pay their bills. That may provide some relief in the short term. But the new administration — like the one before it, and the one before that — faces a much longer-term affordability crisis.</p><p>“We have a huge shortage of housing for pretty much every income level except the very highest,” said David Dworkin, CEO of the National Housing Conference, which advocates for affordable housing.</p><p>The global pandemic shattered the world order and the US economy suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter. The housing market too briefly hit pause in spring. Back in March of 2020, the real estate market looked to be headed into a steep decline due to widespread stay-home orders.</p><p>The pandemic has certainly affected every sector but residential real estate has been very resilient. The real estate sector has also been highly supportive of the economic recovery of the country so far. It has emerged as a pillar of support for the economy. 2020 was a record-breaking year for the US housing market. According to Zillow, in total, 5.64 million homes were sold in 2020, up 5.6% from 2019.</p><p>The typical U.S. home was worth $266,104 in December, up 8.4% (or $20,587) from a year ago. House prices in all the major markets continue to rise. According to economists and market watchers, home values are growing at their fastest pace in a generation, and are showing no signs of slowing down in 2021.</p><p>But behind all this are disturbing trends in Forbearance. the precursor to Foreclosure.</p><p>Seriously delinquent mortgages are up 1.7 million in 2020 to 2.1 million.

      "description": "<p><strong>About Electronics</strong></p><p>Electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that studies electron emission, behavior, and effects using electronic devices. Electronics differs from classical electrical engineering in that it uses active devices to control electron flow via amplification and rectification, whereas classical electrical engineering only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance to control electric current flow.</p><p>Electronics covers an extremely broad range of technology. Initially, the term referred to the study of electron behaviour and movement, particularly as observed in the first electron tubes. With advances in knowledge about the fundamental nature of electrons and how the motion of these particles could be utilised, it came to be used in a broader sense. Many scientific and technical disciplines now deal with various aspects of electronics. The development of key devices such as transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, and optical fibres has resulted from research in these fields. As a result, a wide range of electronic consumer, industrial, and military products can now be manufactured. Indeed, the world is in a state of flux.</p><p>Electronic systems design is concerned with the multidisciplinary design of complex electronic devices and systems such as cell phones and computers. The topic ranges from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to ensuring its proper function, service life, and disposal. Electronic systems design is thus the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to meet the user's specified requirements.</p><p>Laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices due to the complexity of electronics theory. These experiments are used to test or validate the engineer's design and to identify errors. Historically, electronics labs were made up of physical electronics devices and equipment, but in recent years, the trend has shifted to electronics lab simulation software such as CircuitLogix, Multisim, and PSpice.</p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>The <strong>Zen Methodology Secrets To Habit Formation</strong></p><p><strong>If you lies in any of the below point:- </strong></p><p>. Procrastinate when we have difficult work to do. </p><p>· Avoid exercise and seek the comforts of the Internet.</p><p>· Eat unhealthy food and gain too much weight. </p><p>· Become overwhelmed, stressed out, full of anxiety. </p><p>· Put off meeting new people because we’re afraid. </p><p>· Avoid pursuing our dreams, building a business, finding our fulfilling careers. </p><p>· Avoid facing our debts so we can start building a stronger financial foundation. </p><p>· Put off our creative pursuits or the learning we’ve been wanting to do. </p><p>· Fail at new habits. </p><p>· Smoke, drink to excess, become addicted to drugs, even though we know these things aren’t good for us. </p><p>· Doubt ourselves, feel bad about ourselves, compare ourselves to others. </p><p>· Become angry, frustrated, judgmental of others.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What you’ll learn from this course</strong> isn’t how to make yourself a better person—it’s how to remove the things that get in your way. When we do that, we have happiness, peace. We no longer feel anxious, we don’t need to procrastinate, we let go of anger and resentment, and we can fully live in this moment, enjoying it. That’s what this course is about. Delving into the One Problem of the Mind Movie, and practicing with this method by experimenting with a small change . . . and in the process, mastering the skills of discomfort and change. With these skills, we’ll learn to form mindful habits that will make us good at any change we want to make and learn the flexibility we need to stick to that change for the long term. We’ll learn to deal with stress and anxiety, with frustration with ourselves and others, with procrastination and debt, and more. We’ll become masters of change. This is the&nbsp; <strong>Zen Methodology Secrets To Habit Formation.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>One small step at a time. It’s the only way to truly understand the concepts of the change—put them into practice. What I’ve laid out is a step-by-step plan for change, one step at the end of each day.&nbsp; You’ll pick one small change to make, and implement it during the course. This means you’ll be taking the first step in getting used to discomfort, and also practicing a key principle that has helped me to change my life completely: Slow Change. It’s profoundly important, and yet slow change is difficult for most people because they want results right away. Finally, this course will require a commitment: you’ll need to set aside time to learn and practice it. This small time investment, of just 10 minutes a day, will result in great changes in your life if you can commit to it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end of each day, I have issue a exercise for you that will help you to commit to making one small change in your life as you go through this course. </p><p><br></p><p>See You In The Course</p>",

We will then move to internal controls specific to cash including bank reconciliations. </strong></p><p><strong>Bank reconciliations are important controls for both large and small companies. After the double entry accounting system itself, the bank reconciliation is one of the most important internal controls. The bank reconciliation will compare the bank statement to the cash book balance as of a point in time and reconcile the difference between the two. The bank reconciliation process will provide more assurance of the cash account and will provide more assurance over many other accounting processes because most accounting processes include cash. For example, reconciling the bank account provides more assurance over the revenue cycle, purchases cycle, and payroll cycle. </strong></p><p><strong>We will also discuss the setting up and recording of a petting cash account, a process that can be more complex then if first seems. </strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>In addition to instructional video, this course will include downloadable</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Downloadable PDF Files</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Excel Practice Files</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Multiple Choice Practice Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Short Calculation Practice Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Discussion Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The PDF files allow us to download reference information we can use offline and as a guide to help us work through the material.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Excel practice files will be preformatted so that we can focus on the adjusting process and learning some of the basics of Excel, like addition, subtraction, and cell relationships.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple choice example question helps us improve our test-taking skills by reducing the information into the size and format of multiple choice questions and discussing how to approach these questions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Short calculation questions help us reduce problems that have some calculation down to a short format that could be used in multiple choice questions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion Question will provide an opportunity to discuss these topics with the instructor and other students, a process many students find very helpful because it allows us to see the topic from different viewpoints.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will we be learning from?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You will be learning from somebody who is a:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    CPA – Certified Public Accountant</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    CGMA – Chartered Global Management Accountant</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Master of Science in Taxation</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    CPS – Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>•    Curriculum Development Export</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As a CPS and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

      "description": "<p>Companies are always looking for new ways to improve business efficiency and increase quality. To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you'll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don't. You'll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You'll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You'll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.</p><p><strong>What is waste in Lean Manufacturing?</strong></p><p>A core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.</p><p>Today, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World. Seven of the eight wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management’s ability to utilize personnel.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN to</strong></p><ol><li><p>classify production activities as a value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add.</p></li><li><p>identify strategies for eliminating waste caused by overproduction and inventory.</p></li><li><p>identify strategies for eliminating motion, waiting, and transportation waste.</p></li><li><p>identify elimination strategies for waste caused by overprocessing and defects</p></li><li><p>match cycle time and takt time to their descriptions</p></li><li><p>identify the final three steps for balancing a production line</p></li></ol>",

I have tried to all the aspects of the Solar plants which include Technicals, Financial calculations, Financial modelling, Net Metering, Different types of Installations, Monitoring etc. Some of these aspects are generally missed in the other courses. I understand how difficult it is sometimes to explain the technical aspects, therefore I have tried to take the help of analogies and simple to relate examples and calculations for developing an easier understanding of the complex technicalities.</p><p>Being working as a Solar Energy consultant and executed approximately 50 projects with an aggregated capacity of 4000 kWp or 4 MWp, I have been able to gain useful experience and insights. I have tried to pour all my experience into this course, hope this would be valuable. </p><p>Examples from the industrial experience coupled with tips and thumb rules, average calculation formulae etc would really equip the viewer to gain a great command and grip. After, taking this course, a very detailed understanding of all the fundamentals involving Technicals, financial, execution, would help in building up the required confidence for taking up Solar projects or assignments in this field.</p><p>Be ready to cover tons of topics in the Solar field to charge yourself for your Solar expertise.

      "description": "<p>Master course in business communication 2.0</p><p>Messages and conversations are just part of communication. Communication is most important in business to get right, because it means understanding each other's point of view. From the planning stages of any activity to the tracking of its success, everything in the workplace depends on good communication.</p><p>Organisations are constantly inundated with information, from clients to suppliers, from agencies to internal departments. The number of people involved in a single project can be quite large these days because everything needs feedback and approval. When engaging with any individual involved in a project, you have to wear different hats based on seniority. Depending on whom you're trying to communicate with and what their goals are for the project, how you manage your business communication should change. In a business environment, communication is important to ensure efficiency, avoid misunderstandings, and avoid mistakes caused by miscommunication.</p><p>Business communication always has an end goal, unlike personal communication. Almost every company has rules for good business practice when it comes to communication within the workplace. Business communication used to be limited to phone calls and paperwork. Now we've got email, video conferencing, and instant messaging.</p><p>The 5 major topics I'd like to teach in this master's course are:</p><p>1. What business communication 2.0 is and why it's important</p><p>2. The types, principles, and barriers of business communication</p><p>3. What's the connection between entrepreneurship and business communication?</p><p>4. As an entrepreneur, what makes good business communication?</p><p>5. What are the best ways to improve your business communication?</p>",

It is one of the most popular forms of digital marketing today and it is only growing in popularity.

We will discuss what YouTube marketing is, the benefits of it, the tools for effective YouTube marketing strategies, tips to increase your YouTube views, viral YouTube marketing ideas, why you should invest in a YouTube marketing course, and how you can start the journey to becoming a YouTuber now.

YouTube seems&nbsp;the greatest place&nbsp;to grow your own brand, drive traffic to your website, and earn money from ads (leveraging AdSense) that are generated through advertisers who bid on Google&nbsp;and your product and service promotions.&nbsp;<strong>And this superb course is the perfect one&nbsp;for you to kickstart&nbsp;your own YouTube Channel.</strong></p><p>YouTube is a critical marketing tool for practically any company in any industry.&nbsp; Online video advertising is a unique opportunity for companies. Video marketing can be used efficiently to help build confidence and establish an organization as having authority. It also makes it easier for customers to connect and engage with brands worldwide, easily.</p><p><strong>What do we mean by YouTube Marketing?</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms and for a good reason. With its vast reach and engagement, YouTube can be a powerful tool for your marketing arsenal. In this section, we will outline some of the key ways that you can use YouTube to promote your business.</p><p>First and foremost, Youtube is one of the most powerful marketing channels out there. With its vast reach, you can target a large audience with relative ease. Additionally, Youtube allows you to create engaging content that is easy for viewers to consume. By understanding these principles, you will be on your way to creating quality videos that engage your viewers.</p><p>Once you've created quality videos, it's important to understand how to engage viewers with those videos. This means understanding how to capture viewer attention with intro's and outro's, as well as effective use of sound effects and music. </p><p>Additionally, it's important to provide valuable insights or information in your videos so that viewers stick around until the end. Once they're there, it's essential to analyze data and pull insights so that you can create effective campaigns accordingly.</p><p>Of course, even the best video marketing strategy won't work if you don't have any ads running on YouTube which we'll cover next in this course on Youtube Marketing Tips for Businesses. </p><p>Understanding how Youtube Ads work is key to getting the most out of these ads. When you create a campaign, you will have a set budget that you can use to place ads on YouTube. Once your ad is live, you will need to track its performance so that you can adjust as needed. There are several essential tips for creating effective video ads, such as making sure your ad is relevant and engaging, and using catchy titles and descriptions. Finally, there are several ways to optimise your budget so that you're getting the most out of your investment in YouTube Ads.</p><p>Finally, once everything is in place – from strategy through execution – it's important to track performance metrics so that you know where YOUR efforts are paying off! In all honesty though – success with online video marketing doesn't stop at simply creating great content; it also requires smart targeting of ads (spending money). </p><p>In order for growth on Youtube to be sustainable, it's important to grow loyal followers who will continue watching even when you fall out of favour with recent trends or topics. You can achieve this by creating engaging videos that are informative and entertaining at the same time – making sure not to bore viewers or bombard them with too much information at once!&nbsp;<em>You will learn such amazing things in this course!&nbsp;Read on, further.</em></p><p><strong>What does this ultimate YouTube Marketing course hold for you?</strong></p><p>In this course which is focused on <strong>\"Viral YouTube Marketing\",</strong> I've shared all my ideas, tips, and tricks to help you come out of the creator’s block and make viral videos to post on the YouTube portal to accomplish your goals and become famous. YouTube now seems to be the fastest money-making portal out there - once you take this course and learn all the info. It is important to test your campaigns and collect data on which techniques are most effective to determine which YouTube advertising and marketing strategies work for you, once you go through the course. Try to test the tips taught in these areas: video ideation and content concepts etc.</p><p>Whether you have previous experience with YouTube or not, it doesn't matter here. But be keen to apply this knowledge to create new videos to post on the most popular YouTube platform every day and you will be making huge subscriber numbers, leads, sales, and quick good money in a short time! Your YouTube channel will only boom if you implement the tricks I teach.</p><p>You will learn the professional tactics, tips, and strategies that I use all the time for the ideation process to create successful YouTube videos in multiple niches - be it&nbsp;fan reaction videos, review videos,&nbsp;explainer videos,&nbsp;remix videos,&nbsp;unboxing videos,&nbsp;chipmunk music videos,&nbsp;mashup videos, etc.</p><p>With this current YouTube virality course, you will become a Professional YouTube Expert in just a couple of days, even if it comes to learning from Scratch! </p><p>I wish you luck to become a huge YouTube sensation this year with the power of leveraging videos. </p><p><strong><em>What are you going to get from this mind-blowing YouTube ultimate training course?</em></strong></p><p>Viral YouTube videos are not rocket science – but they do take effort and dedication. There are plenty of good YouTube video ideas you can come up with, but the most important thing is to execute them correctly – otherwise, people are not going to discover and find your videos interesting or they won’t find these videos at all.</p><p>To help you out I’ve prepared a list of video ideas for YouTube that you can use on the road to creating your first viral video. Just don’t forget: it takes time! Some people do succeed immediately when they begin creating their channel on YouTube and without even trying that hard. But those people usually have no idea what to do next - whether they can continue making good YouTube videos or collaborate with other YouTube experts etc. This is why it’s better to have plenty of ideas before you start – and that’s what this amazing YouTube virality course is here for! Think of this course as your YouTube video idea generator! What’s more? Think of it as your next revenue-generation idea stream for your YouTube channel.&nbsp;I will also provide you with a bonus method of generating tags for your YouTube videos on your channel.</p><p>So hop on YouTube lovers, let's roll. Myself, <strong>Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>will take you down further into a new wave in the world of video marketing.</p><p>Welcome to the next generation of video ideation and secret techniques. If you are still not clear on why to opt for this course, read below the immense benefits that YouTube Marketing provides you!</p><p><strong>The Immense Benefits Of YouTube Marketing</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the most popular video platforms in the world, and for good reason. It has a massive audience that you can reach with minimal effort. Plus, YouTube is incredibly cost effective to run – there's no need to hire staff or spend big on advertising.</p><p>First and foremost, YouTube offers a global audience that you can reach with ease. Second, with its simple and easy-to-use interface, managing your videos is a breeze. Third, comments and live streams are a great way to keep viewers engaged. And fourth – and perhaps most importantly – YouTube's powerful algorithms can help you build visibility and drive traffic back to your site or blog.</p><p>To make sure that your videos are performing as well as possible, it's important to take advantage of all of YouTube's custom settings and tools. Additionally, using YouTube analytics provides you with valuable insights into viewer demographics and watch time. Finally, paid ads on YouTube can be used to target specific audiences so that your message reaches them in the most effective way possible.</p><p>YouTube is one of the most popular video sharing platforms on the internet, and it's easy to see why. With over 1.5 billion active users, YouTube provides an accessible way for businesses of all sizes to reach a wider audience than ever before. In this section, we'll outline some effective marketing strategies that you can use to maximize your results on YouTube.</p><p>Nevertheless, it's important to understand that YouTube is a diverse platform – not just for viewers but also for creators. This means that you can target a larger audience with your videos than you might be used to with other mediums. For example, if you're selling products online, you can create videos aimed at a general audience as well as niche markets. Additionally, YouTube allows for longer videos than other social media platforms which makes it perfect for detailed product descriptions or tutorials.</p><p>To boost engagement with your audience, make sure to utilize interactive content in your videos. This could involve quizzes or polls that participants can enter into or interactive demonstrations of products or services. By engaging your viewers this way, you'll drive more interest in your content and hopefully convert more leads into customers!</p><p>The introduction of YouTube Shorts also, which now receives an average of over 30 billion daily views globally—four times more than a year ago—has made it easier for creators to engage with more viewers. By checking out the material of these new audiences in different formats like VOD and live streaming, they have in turn increased the reach of the creators.</p><p>Let's start learning about YouTube Marketing now as you may have numerous doubts that have been cleared by me!&nbsp; There is no time to wait at all!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Master course in public speaking, If you've considered why a firm pays big bucks for a motivational speaker, it's because this person inspires people to improve their performance. In a small business, you might not be able to afford motivational speakers, but you are a public speaker each day for your staff. You must inspire people to achieve the goals you have for your small business.</p><p><strong>Overview of Importance</strong></p><p>Public speaking skills help you communicate important messages inside and outside of the organization. By practicing public speaking, you learn how to prepare a message for each type of audience. For example, you would prepare a different speech for a fund-raising dinner than you would for a parent-teacher conference. Over time, you learn to think on your feet, taking information from the social environment and changing your communication patterns to suit the occasion.</p><p><strong>Importance of Clear Expression</strong></p><p>A small business needs employees who can communicate what they're thinking in a clear manner. When you work for someone else, you can improve these skills over time. When you work for yourself as a small business owner, you need to express yourself clearly every day, especially when you're dealing with customers.</p><p><strong>Importance of Working With Diverse Audiences</strong></p><p>Your skills in public speaking are tested when you must perform different jobs that are really public speaking in disguise. For example, if you must interview people for a job opening in your organization, you will get diverse candidates. You must be able to talk with them in person or on the phone and determine whether they have the combination of qualities to succeed in the job. You will have to communicate with them frequently if they join your work organization.</p><p><strong>Importance for Leadership</strong></p><p>Most of all, public speaking skills are important for leaders. Whether you serve as a president of a civic group or run a small firm, you must communicate with an intent, such as to persuade, to inform or to motivate. You should be able to ask questions, state what your organization needs, represent a position on an issue, respond to other people's opinions and build consensus. If you cannot communicate clearly and motivate others through public speaking, it will be harder to realize your goals for your small business.</p><p>In this master course you can learn five major topics, </p><p>1. Introduction and importance of public speaking</p><p>2. Types and elements of public speaking</p><p>3. Skills of speaking in public</p><p>4. How to be a good speaker and characteristics of effective public speaker</p><p>5. Confidence Public speaking with presentation skills</p><p><br></p>",

However, we believe it’s an important idea and so this post examines the term and tries to come up with a succinct but all encompassing definition of what it is – better than the many others currently available.

      "description": "<p>Master course of Time management, Actually we are know about, Time is a resource and needs to be utilized in an effective and efficient manner to achieve the desired goal. The importance of managing time has been put forth by the legendary statesman, Benjamin Franklin in his popular quote, \"Time is money\".</p><p><strong>What is Time Management? </strong>Time Management is the act or process of planning and exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency or productivity. Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to manage time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects and goals complying with a due date. This set encompasses a wide scope of activities, and these include planning, allocating, setting goals, delegation, monitoring, organizing, scheduling, and prioritizing.</p><p>Planning is the process of thinking about and organizing the activities required to achieve a desired goal. It helps to increase the efficiency and minimize the risks in goal accomplishment. Patrick Montana and Bruce Charnov outline a three-step result-oriented process for planning:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>STEP 1: Choosing a destination; STEP 2: Evaluating alternative routes, and; STEP 3: Deciding the specific course of your plan.</p></li></ol><p>Allocating is the task to organize the available resources to achieve a particular goal. In project management, resource allocation is the scheduling of activities and the resources required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.</p><p>Setting goals is the most important aspect of time management. A goal is a measurable target and needs to have a time bound plan. A simple and conventional way to set goals is to break them into short and long term goals. Goals cease to have their relevance without a time framework.</p><p>Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work.</p><p>Monitoring is the process of reducing the variance between the desired and current performance w.r.t the desired goal.This ensures that the task accomplishment is on time and tends to reduce/eliminate unproductive time.</p><p>In this master course you can learn about 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction and importance of time management</p><p>2. Types and benefits of time management and key to success</p><p>3. Advantages and characteristics of time management</p><p>4. Important facts and tips of time management</p><p>5. How to develop time management skills and time management strategies</p>",

As a holistic approach it also incorporates other acknowledged online marketing techniques like search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, e-mail marketing, CRM, web automation etc. The main idea behind Inbound Marketing is to attract visitors to a website by creating and distributing useful content, convert those visitors into leads, earn their trust and then turn them into loyal customers. Inbound Marketing 101 course and KPI &amp;&nbsp;Google Analystics approach is focused on pull marketing techniques rather than push techniques that interrupt the internet users with an advertising message. Therefore, essential for this strategy is to develop high quality and targeted content, make it available on a search engine friendly web site and share the information on the social media and by other effective means (Zlatko, 2015).

      "description": "<p><strong>Master course in logistics and supply chain management 2.0</strong></p><p><strong>Logistics</strong></p><p>When used in a business sense, logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet requirements of customers or corporations. The resources managed in logistics can include physical items such as food, materials, animals, equipment, and liquids, as well as abstract items, such as time and information.</p><p>The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow, material handling, production, packaging, inventory, transportation, and warehousing. There is often confusion over the difference between logistics and supply chains.</p><p>It is now generally accepted that logistics refers to activities within one company/organization related to the distribution of a product, whereas supply chain also encompasses manufacturing and procurement and therefore has a much broader focus, as it involves multiple enterprises, including suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers, working together to meet a customer’s need for a product or service.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong></p><p>supply chain management is the process of managing the movement of the raw materials and parts from the beginning of production through delivery to the consumer. In many organizations, operational supply chain decisions are made hundreds of times each day affecting how products are developed, manufactured, moved, and sold.</p><p>The complexity of the supply chain varies with the size of the business and the intricacy and quantity of items manufactured, but most supply chains have elements in common, such as the following:</p><p><strong>· Customers: </strong>Customers start the chain of events when they decide to purchase a product that has been offered for sale by a company. If the product has to be manufactured, the sales order will include a requirement that needs to be fulfilled by the production facility.</p><p><strong>· Planning: </strong>The planning department will create a production plan to produce the products to fulfill the customer’s orders. To manufacture the products, the company will then have to purchase the raw materials needed.</p><p><strong>· Purchasing:</strong> The purchasing department receives a list of raw materials and services required by the production department to complete the customers’ orders.</p><p><strong>· Inventory:</strong> The raw materials are received from the suppliers, checked for quality and accuracy, and moved into the warehouse.</p><p><strong>· Production</strong>: Based on a production plan, the raw materials are moved to the production area. These raw materials are used to manufacture the finished products ordered by the customer and then sent to the warehouse where they await shipping.</p><p>In this master course you will learn the major 5 sessions,</p><p>1. Introduction of Logistics and Supply Chain Management</p><p>2. Global environment of business and International trade procedures</p><p>3. Shipment and Supply chain operations</p><p>4. Port and Airport management for logistics and Drop shipping</p><p>5. Supply chain risk modelling and management</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Master course in Human resources 2.0</strong></p><p>An effective human resources (HR) management department can help provide organizational structure and the ability to meet business needs by managing your business’s most valuable asset – your employees.</p><p>Several disciplines make up the HR department, and human resources managers working at smaller companies might perform more than one of the five main duties: talent management, compensation and benefits for employees, training and development, compliance, and workplace safety.</p><p>1.\tTalent Management</p><p>The talent management team in the HR department covers a lot of ground. What used to be distinct areas of the department have been rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining employees.</p><p>Recruiters are the heavy lifters in building any company’s workforce. They’re responsible for the total hiring process including posting positions on job boards, sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating with the hiring manager responsible for making the final selection. A recruiter’s success is determined by several key metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media, career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and reasons why an applicant wasn’t hired. </p><p>Employee relations or support is the area of the talent management team that is concerned with strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600+ billion each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the success of your business.</p><p>If the company has a unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations, including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and interpreting labor union contract questions.</p><p>The talent management group is also home to HR practitioners who focus on workforce planning and management. This area includes succession planning and retention efforts across the business, from the C-suite on down. When an employee resigns, retires, is fired or laid off, gets sick, or dies, the workforce planning team kicks into action.</p><p>2.\tCompensation and Benefits</p><p>In smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay practices of competitors and establishing the compensation structure. The compensation department is also responsible for creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as well as working with talent management on succession planning.</p><p>On the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the company’s 401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service provider. Those that don’t generally put payroll practitioners in a separate team that works on the tactical process of generating payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and strategy.</p><p>3.\tTraining and Development</p><p>Every company wants to see its employees thrive, which means providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools aren’t necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software, or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee orientation, leadership training programs, personal and professional development, and managerial training. Training and development (sometimes called learning and development) is an integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee role played at the company, the training team might be responsible for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and universities offer degrees in training and development; an instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.</p><p>4.\tHR Compliance</p><p>Legal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR department. Employment and labor laws are highly complex, and having a team devoted to monitoring this ever-changing landscape is essential to keeping companies out of trouble with federal, state, and local governments’ laws. When a business is out of compliance, it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working conditions. </p><p>The HR compliance team is also heavily involved—working in tandem with other HR practitioners—in developing all company policy that makes up the employee handbook. </p><p>5.\tWorkplace Safety</p><p>A large focus area for HR is developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work. In addition, this department often works hand-in-hand with benefits specialists to manage the company’s Workers’ Compensation filings.</p><p>In this master course, you will learn the 5 major sessions.,</p><p>1. Introduction of human resources 2.0</p><p>2. Business environment and strategic planning</p><p>3. HR Audit and human capital management</p><p>4. Training, Planning and development of Human resources</p><p>5. Labour welfare and HR Information system</p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>The circular economy is an evolution of the way the world produces and consumes both goods and services.</p><p>The circular model redefines the economy around principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible. Equally vital are restoring the world’s wilderness, building regenerative agricultural systems, using renewable materials, and shifting to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Who invented the circular economy?</p><p>There was no single creator of the idea of a circular economy. The term is largely a 21st century construct, but the principles behind it were first talked about in the mid-twentieth century.</p><p>Kenneth Boulding’s The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth (1966), Herman Daly’s notion of a ‘steady-state economy’ from 1974, and Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (2002) by Michael Braungart and Bill McDonough are seminal publications on the topic.</p><p>What are the benefits of a circular economy?</p><p>A circular economy offers a wide range of social, economic, and environmental benefits.</p><p>By maximising the lifetime of our products and materials and designing out waste, circularity reduces both our demand for raw materials and the environmental impact associated with obtaining them.</p><p>And using recycled raw materials will, in most cases, use less energy when manufacturing products, therefore reducing carbon emissions. Circularity reduces both our demand for raw materials and the environmental impact of obtaining them. Why circular economy is the future? Reduced Waste; By implementing circular economy models, we can significantly reduce the amount of waste being produced and increase economic growth by creating new industries around better managing the waste being produced.</p><p>Circularity also promises to deliver substantial economic benefits. Scaling up reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling creates millions of jobs and stimulates innovation. Capturing and reusing critical materials such as rare earth metals helps make the economy more resilient to global supply chain shocks and ensures the world has the materials to create the renewable energy infrastructure it needs.</p><p>In this master course of Circular economy&nbsp; 3.0, you can learn 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction and Overview of Circular Economy 3.0</p><p>2. Main Concepts and Components of Circular Economy</p><p>3. Circular Economy and Business Ideas and benefits</p><p>4.

Data models provide a blueprint for designing a new database or reengineering a legacy application. Overall, data modeling helps an organization use its data effectively to meet business needs for information.</p><p>A data model can be thought of as a flowchart that illustrates data entities, their attributes and the relationships between entities. It enables data management and analytics teams to document data requirements for applications and identify errors in development plans before any code is written.</p><p>Alternatively, data models can be created through reverse-engineering efforts that extract them from existing systems. That's done to document the structure of relational databases that were built on an ad hoc basis without upfront data modeling and to define schemas for sets of raw data stored in data lakes or NoSQL databases to support specific analytics applications.</p><p>Data modeling occurs at three levels—physical, logical, and conceptual.</p><p>•\tA physical model is a schema or framework for how data is physically stored in a database.</p><p>•\tA conceptual model identifies the high-level, user view of data.</p><p>•\tA logical data model sits between the physical and conceptual levels and allows for the logical representation of data to be separate from its physical storage.</p><p>This blog post will primarily discuss logical data modeling.</p><p>DATA MODELS DESCRIBE BUSINESS ENTITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS</p><p>Data models are made up of entities, which are the objects or concepts we want to track data about, and they become the tables in a database.

      "description": "<p>This is Master course in sales - Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods sold in a given targeted time period. The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale.</p><p>There is a real art to selling, as any salesperson probably knows. You walk a fine line between alienating the customer and making them feel comfortable. Sales is not something you can pick up right away; it takes time and practice to perfect the art of closing a deal. Developing a solid and proven technique is a big part of learning how to sell efficiently. Here are five selling techniques every salesperson should master.</p><p>According to Active Listening, One of the reasons that prospective clients are so wary of salespeople is because they anticipate a pushy demeanor and pressure to purchase a client. Setting out with a clear agenda and not interacting with the client beyond a fixed aim is a mistake; it won’t win you sales and it definitely won’t win you fans. More effective selling techniques involve active listening— allowing for a dialogue with the customer that isn’t just a one-sided conversation. Listening to their concerns, questions, and hesitations will help you respond to them better, and will help the prospective client trust you more as well. People who trust you are much more likely to make a purchase with you.</p><p>According to Warm Calls, Relying on cold calls is an ineffective sales technique; they irritate potential clients and are often screened anyway. Shifting to a warm calling is a much better—and more efficient—way of handling selling. Warm calls involve calling prospective clients who have been chosen for their potential to be receptive to your sales pitch. This includes “warming up” leads through things like social media outreach and prior research of the client. Warm calling leads to much higher success rates, since it does away with the scatter shot approach to selling, which is often just a waste of your time. </p><p>Features &amp; Benefits: This one may seem obvious, but it’s not always efficiently carried out by the salesperson. While it’s important to go over the practical functions of a product or service, simply describing the service or product and its various functions isn’t enough to convince someone to make a purchase. The prospective client doesn’t just need to know how it works, they need to understand why they should care. Emphasizing the features and benefits of the product, and the ways it can prove valuable to the potential client, is a classic and effective selling technique that is continually reiterated because it works. </p><p>Needs &amp; Solutions : People like practical reasons why they should invest in a product or service, and they’re more likely to listen to a sales pitch if it offers an effective solution. This sales technique works best with the technique of active listening; it’s important to listen to the client to get a sense of how the product could benefit them, and then tailor your pitch to that individual or company. The sense that the sales pitch has been personalized will make feel the client more comfortable trusting and listening to the salesperson, because they feel like they’re learning about a solution that will work for them, not just you.</p><p>According to Social Selling, Huge pools of potential clients are easily accessible through online social networking, and when you discourage the use of social media as a selling technique, you limit the scope of your salespeople and are potentially standing in the way of future sales. Social media and online connectivity are huge parts of modern communication, and it’s important to adapt to this way of doing business. Actively encourage salespeople to reach out to potential clients and foster leads through social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter; you’re sales numbers will thank you. </p><p>In this master course you will learn 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction of marketing, sales and sales skills</p><p>2. Types of Sales and Sales in Business</p><p>3. Marketing Vs Sales</p><p>4. Negotiation skills in sales</p><p>5.

Be punctual for meetings, arrive at the workplace on time, and conduct your business in a way that won't inconvenience anyone. Take cues from others you work with so your behavior aligns with their needs and expectations. As mentioned earlier, business etiquette is a code of conduct that isn't just for the top brass of the company. It must be part of the company's culture and values. Several jobs may require a more elevated form of business etiquette than others. For example, customer service, sales, marketing and other roles like these require employees to be aware of business etiquette.</p><p>In this master course you can learn the 5 Major topics,</p><p>1.

      "description": "<p>Master Course in Business Model and Business Model Canvas : A business model isn't something you build from the ground up. When management-types ask about a business model — as in, \"So what's your business model?\" — they really want an answer to a much more direct and basic question: \"How do you plan to make money?\"</p><p>Behind the question of What is your Business Model?, is a lineup of other questions:</p><p>· Who's your target customer?</p><p>· What customer problem or challenge do you solve?</p><p>· What value do you deliver?</p><p>· How will you reach, acquire, and keep customers?</p><p>· How will you define and differentiate your offering?</p><p>· How will you generate revenue?</p><p>· What's your cost structure?</p><p>· What's your profit margin?</p><p>During the 1990s, when the business world was buzzing with talk about a new economy and new business rules, people — even business gurus — seemed to forget the part about making money, and businesspeople sidelined the use of business models. But when the dot-com boom began to bust, suddenly everybody started asking about business models again.</p><p>The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic management tool to quickly and easily define and communicate a business idea or concept.</p><p>It is a one-page document that works through the fundamental elements of a business or product, structuring an idea in a coherent way.</p><p>The right side of the BMC focuses on the customer (external), while, the left side of the canvas focuses on the business (internal).</p><p>Both external and internal factors meet around the value proposition, which is the exchange of value between your business and your customer/clients.</p><p>In this master course you can learn the 5 Major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction and importance of business model and business model canvas</p><p>2. Types of business model and how to design the best business model</p><p>3. Pillars and main components of business model</p><p>4. Importance, components and features and purpose of business model canvas</p><p>5. How to create a business model canvas</p>",

The relationships between organisms of the same species and from different species are complex. Different organisms are under different selective pressures because of these complex interactions. Natural selection happens when the pressures combine, causing populations of species to evolve. The study of ecology looks at these forces, their sources, and the complex relationships between organisms, and between organisms and their surroundings.</p><p>Ecosystems, a term often used in biology, are communities of plants and animals living in close proximity to one another and their non-living environments. A non-living environment includes weather, earth, sun, soil, climate, and atmosphere.</p><p>The term \"climate change\" refers to changes in the weather, oceans, land surfaces, and ice sheets, over the course of decades or more</p><p>Climate change can change where species live, how they interact, and when biological events happen, which could fundamentally alter current ecosystems. As a result of climate change, ecosystems may be unable to mitigate extreme events and disturbances.</p><p>The 5 major topics I want to cover in this master's course are:</p><p>1. An introduction to ecology, ecosystems, and climate change</p><p>2. Discussion with business and ecology about types, branches, and scope of ecology</p><p>3.

Buying supplies depends entirely on the demand for the end products a company makes.</p><p>Inventory management: how does it work?</p><p>There are two ways to look at end-product demand: independent demand and dependent demand. First of all, independent demand is when the amount required isn't dependent on another supply. Customers usually buy these finished goods. In inventory management, independent demand comes from previous sales history, forecasts, educated estimates, and purchased orders.</p><p>Dependent demand, by contrast, is needed when one supply is predicated on another. In dependent demand, raw materials are used to make finished goods and end products.</p><p>Concept of Inventory Control:</p><p>Inventory control refers to a lot of different things that are related only in that both require adequate inventory records and receipts and issues corresponding to these two functions. Control over accounting and control over operations are interpreted as one.</p><p>Inventories are controlled by properly recording receipts and consumption of materials, as well as the flow of goods through the factory and to the customer.</p><p>Besides raw materials, work-in-progress, and semi-finished products, it also protects the undertaking's property. In inventory control, inventory levels are maintained at an optimum level based on operational needs and financial resources. This course cover the content of Inventory Management, Inventory Control, Logistics management, Supply Chain and Stocks management,&nbsp; Warehouse management and Droposhipping process.</p><p>The 5 major topics I want to cover in this master's course are:</p><p>1. Introduction and the importance of inventory management and inventory control</p><p>2. Inventory formula, benefits, purpose and types of inventory management</p><p>3. Process of Inventory Management and Techniques for Small Businesses</p><p>4. Best practices, advantages, processes and types of inventory control</p><p>5. Inventory control techniques and methods of operations management and cost accounting</p>",

      "description": "<p>Master course in sales forecasting and sales management 2.0 : The process of estimating future sales (revenues) is called sales forecasting. Although this seems daunting at first, it can actually be done fairly painlessly with some application. The key to forecasting sales is to understand the underlying assumptions and drivers of sales, then track and manage them.</p><p>A forecast can be described as an indication of what's likely to happen in a certain field in the future. In other words, a sales forecast tells you how much of a particular product is likely to sell in a specified market at a specified price in the future.</p><p>The ability to forecast sales accurately is key to a business' ability to produce the right amount at the right time. In addition, raw materials, equipment, and labor are all arranged in advance. The material is generally produced in advance in order to meet future demand, but some firms manufacture by order.</p><p>The process of estimating future work, like sales, includes estimating quantity, type, and quality. Having a thorough assessment of market trends is very critical for any manufacturing company. Future planning of the entire company depends on this forecast from the sales department.</p><p>What is sales management?</p><p>In sales management, you develop a sales force, coordinate sales operations, and implement sales techniques so you can hit sales targets consistently.</p><p>An effective sales management strategy is essential for any business. No matter what industry you're in, precision sales management processes are always the key to managing sales and boosting performance. Effective sales managers inspire and lead their teams.</p><p>Your sales management system can also help you stay in touch with your industry as it grows, which can make all the difference between surviving and flourishing. This course will execute the lecture concepts with Forecasting, Sales forecasting, Forecasting model, Time Series Analysis, B2B sales, Sales management and Sales skills.</p><p>This master course will cover 5 major topics: </p><p>1. Introduction and importance of sales forecasting and sales management 2.0</p><p>2. How to build a sales forecast for your business</p><p>3. Types, techniques and methods of sales forecasting in sales management</p><p>4. Sales forecasting using machine learning</p><p>5. Sales management in sales and distribution management</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>¿CUÁLES SON LAS VENTAJAS DE TENER CORREOS CORPORATIVOS PARA TU NEGOCIO?</strong></p><p><strong><br>Mejor imagen corporativa:</strong> Es la primera ventaja que surge de contar con un dominio propio. Le aporta seriedad, confianza y autoridad a tu marca ante tus clientes y proveedores.</p><p><br></p><p>De este modo, el dominio te ayuda a mostrar una imagen que refleje compromiso y confianza, y además es una forma de permitir que los usuarios identifiquen fácilmente tu negocio online.</p><p><br></p><p>Y es que no genera mucha confianza una empresa cuyo correo electrónico sea una cuenta de Gmail o de Outlook (Hotmail).</p><p><br></p><p>Contactar a ventas@tumarca(.)com es más serio que escribir a ventas.tumarca@gmail(.)com. Así se generará la sensación de que tu marca no cuida suficientemente los detalles.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comunicación más efectiva:</strong> Muchos emprendedores suelen mezclar las soluciones de comunicación efectivas con las que son de carácter gratuito.</p><p><br></p><p>Con esto nos referimos a que elegir una cuenta de correo electrónico gratuito significa quedar atado a ciertas características indeseables. Imaginemos que le enviamos una propuesta interesante a uno de nuestros mejores clientes. Es posible que, ese email termine perdido en la bandeja de Spam, por lo que se aumentan las probabilidades de que nunca sea abierto.</p><p><br></p><p>Un gran porcentaje de cuentas gratuitas se utiliza para hacer spam y tus mail pueden ser catalogados de la misma manera si son de cuentas gratuitas. Es un riesgo que no vale nada la pena.</p><p><br></p><p>Así pues, contar con un dominio propio hará que tus clientes reciban con seguridad todos tus emails con promociones e información que podría interesarles en su bandeja de entrada principal, por lo que no perderás ninguna oportunidad.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mejor gestión de información y comunicación: </strong>Una de las mejores ventajas de contar con un dominio para los correos electrónicos de tu empresa, es que este te permite crear listas o grupos de trabajo. De este modo, tus colaboradores podrán comunicarse de una manera más sencilla y profesional, al mismo tiempo que aumentan el rendimiento del trabajo en equipo.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Garantiza tu privacidad:</strong> sino lo sabías, al crear una cuenta de email en una empresa como Google, debes aceptar obligatoriamente sus políticas de privacidad. Esto significa que Google tendrá acceso a tu información, por lo que esta será usada para mostrarte publicidad personalizada.</p><p><br></p><p>En cambio, con un dominio y servidor propio, tendrás la tranquilidad de mantener los datos y la información de tu empresa en buenas manos, pues tu empresa de hosting te garantiza no compartir esta información con terceros. Así, solo tu tendrás control absoluto de tu información.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mayor seguridad de tus correos:</strong> al momento de gestionar una cuenta de correos esto es muy importante. Casi todos los servicios de correos corporativos tienen mayores medidas y protocolos de seguridad ante el posible hackeo o ataque a través de virus por terceros. Existen antivirus, firewalls y filtros anti-spam muy avanzados para proteger tu información confidencial, tus cuentas, dispositivos y equipos.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EN ESTE CURSO, APRENDERÁS:<br><br></strong></p><ul><li><p>Cómo obtener un dominio y hosting para crear tus correos corporativos con dominio propio.</p></li><li><p>Cómo conectar el dominio a tu plan de hosting para comenzar a crear tus correos corporativos con dominio propio.</p></li><li><p>Cómo crear una cuenta de correo corporativa con dominio propio.</p></li><li><p>Cómo crear una cuenta de correo electrónico en Gmail.</p></li><li><p>Cómo configurar tu correo corporativo con dominio propio en Gmail.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Crea Correos Corporativos con Dominio Propio en Gmail,</strong> es el curso más completo que encontrará en Internet, curso que le mostrará todo lo que necesita saber para crear correos corporativos con dominio propio en Gmail, sin tener conocimientos previos, de forma fácil y simple.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>¿QUÉ ME CALIFICA PARA ENSEÑARTE?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Mi nombre es Renato y soy el creador de uno de los canales de YouTube más populares del mundo en el sector del marketing digital: <strong>Programación Fácil, SEO y Marketing</strong>, con más de <strong>170,000 estudiantes (Botón de Plata de YouTube)</strong>, más de <strong>80 MILLONES de reproducciones</strong> y miles de comentarios en mis tutoriales, tales como estos:<br><br></p><ul><li><p><em>Hola te felicito por los tutoriales, muy bien explicados y sobretodo de mucha utilidad.

      "description": "<p>Merhaba arkadaşlar Kurşun kalem, kuru boya kalemleri ve tükenmez kalem ile 3 boyutlu resimler yapabilme ve yaratıcılık sınırlarını zorlama eğitimidir. Başlamak için 1 resim kalemi 1 silgi ve 1 kağıt yeterlidir. Evde bulunabilecek malzeme ve materyaller ile başlayabilirsiniz. Öncelikle başlangıçta kalemleri tanımak, kalem tutuşu, hangi kalem seçimi yapacağımızı göreceğiz. Mesafe, derinlik, dolgu, tonlama, ışık-gölge, yakın-uzak ilişkisi, tümsek-çukur, tek kaçış noktalı perspektif, iki kaçış noktalı perspektif, üç kaçış noktalı perspektif çizimleri yapacağız. Ayrıca imgesel de çalışacağız yani hayal gücüne dayalı rastgele olacak. Yaratıcılığı artırıcı ve bakış açısını değiştiren bir eğitim olacaktır. Artık öğrencilerim çok yönlü bakıp düşünebilecekler. Bunun haricinde bakarak obje, nesne çizimi yapabilecekler. 3 boyutlu çizimlerin çeşitlerinden bahsedeceğiz bunun içerisinde kağıt kesme işlemi yaparak da farklı 3 boyutlu çizimler de yapacağız. Bu eğitimin en güzel yanı da 7 yaş ve üzeri her yaşa hitap etmesidir. </p><p>Yalnız resim işi severek isteyerek yapmakla olur. Kimi çalışmalar uzun süre uğraş verilmesi isteyebilir. Bu eğitim sadece el becerisi zannedilmesin ilk başta bakış açısını değiştirerek analitik düşünmeyi sağlayacaktır. </p><p>Daha önce yüz yüze verdiğim 8-10 yaş eğitim grubumdan velilerden çok güzel geri dönüşler aldım. Ayrıca sergilere resimlerim davet edildi. İlkokula başlamadan resme olan merakım çevremdekiler tarafından fark edildi. Orta okul ve lisede de yaptığım resimler dikkat çekti. Ta ki evlenip çocuğum olana kadar ve çocuğum benden sürekli hayvan resimleri çizmemi istediğinden hayvan figürleri sonrasında da 3 boyutlu çizime yöneldim. Bu resimler paylaşımlarımda inanılmaz beğenildi. </p><p>Unutmayın aynı resme bakan herkes aynı şeyi göremez.</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>Hello friends It is a training to make 3D pictures with pencils, dry crayons and ballpoint pens and to push the limits of creativity.&nbsp; To get started, 1 art pen, 1 eraser and 1 piece of paper are enough.&nbsp; You can start with supplies and materials that can be found at home.&nbsp; First of all, we will see at the beginning to get to know the pencils, pencil grip, which pencil we will choose.&nbsp; We will draw distance, depth, filling, toning, light-shadow, close-distance relationship, bump-pit, perspective with one vanishing point, perspective with two vanishing points, and perspective with three vanishing points.&nbsp; We're also going to work imaginatively, so it's going to be imaginatively random.&nbsp; It will be an education that increases creativity and changes the perspective.&nbsp; Now my students will be able to look and think from multiple angles.&nbsp; Apart from this, they will be able to draw objects and objects by looking.&nbsp; We will talk about the types of 3D drawings, and we will also make different 3D drawings by cutting paper.&nbsp; The best part of this training is that it appeals to all ages 7 years and older.</p><p><br></p><p>Painting is possible only by doing it willingly.&nbsp; Some jobs may require a long effort.&nbsp; This training will not only be considered as a manual skill, but will change the perspective and provide analytical thinking.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> I received very good feedback from the parents of my 8-10 age group, which I gave face to face before.&nbsp; In addition, my paintings were invited to exhibitions.&nbsp; Before I started primary school, my interest in painting was noticed by those around me.&nbsp; The pictures I made in middle and high school drew attention.&nbsp; I turned to 3D drawing after animal figures until I got married and had a child and my child constantly asked me to draw animal pictures.&nbsp; These pictures received incredible likes on my posts.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Remember, not everyone who looks at the same picture can see the same thing.</p>",

This no-frills course gives you nothing but the bare essentials--you should be able to complete the course in 30 minutes or less. That way you will have more time to practice for your upcoming interview.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has trained more than 10,000 executives from six continents over the last 30 years including Presidents of countries, Prime Ministers, Nobel Peace Prize winners, Members of parliament, US Senators and Miss Universes. He will teach you the same techniques that leading executives pay top dollar for in one-on-one training sessions.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tReputations are often made or broken during the first few media interviews conducted during a crisis or breaking news story event. You do NOT want to learn through trial and error in front of thousands or even millions of viewers/listeners/readers.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThere is a system for preparing mentally and emotionally for every interview. Walker's techniques are not common sense, but they are easy to learn and easy to follow. More importantly, they will help you get the ultimate result you are looking for:&nbsp; your message in the final story.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tNow is your chance to learn essential media training skills from a first-class media trainer. You will not regret signing up for this class.

And the instructor also provides an enhanced guarantee.</p><p><br></p><p>Here is what Udemy students say about this course:</p><p><em>\"TJ Walker not only knows what he's talking about but also delivers essential information in an engaging manner with clear examples of what to do and what not to do. He's spot on regarding messaging (refining the three points you need to make) and how to prepare on short notice. Between the training videos and the PDF books included in the course, it's invaluable -- and affordable for just about anyone. I took a media training course in NYC which required me to fly in for three entire weekends over the course of three consecutive months; TJ Walker covered essentially the same content right here. I've worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I've been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I'm picky; and I'm typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren't high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch. Whether you have only two hours or up to two days before your interview, you'll have a significantly better chance of success by investing part of that time in taking this\" </em>Linda Lowen</p><p>***</p><p><em>''I faced a lot of tvs, Radio, and Phone interviews in recent months. My only desire is I wish I had discovered this course prior. This knowledge is more than helpful, it ensures professional approaches, techniques, styles and clear explanations. Great work TJ keep em coming. Our company paid in excess of $3500 to have 4 (1hr) training sessions for 3 staff and I learned a lot more in this quick 40 min course, GREAT VALUE !!''</em>&nbsp; Robert Masters</p><p><br></p>",

It has built-in functions for manipulating arrays. We can convert different algorithms to can into functions for applying on arrays. NumPy has applications that are not only limited to itself. It is a very diverse library and has a wide range of applications in other sectors. Numpy can be put to use along with Data Science, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. It is also a base for other python libraries. These libraries use the functionalities in NumPy to increase their capabilities.</p><p><br></p><p>This course introduce with all majority of concept of NumPy - numerical python library.</p><p>You will learn following topics :</p><p>1) Creating Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>2) Accessing Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>3) Finding Dimension of the Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>4) Negative Indexing on Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>5) Slicing an Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>6) Checking Datatype of an Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>7) Copying an Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>8) Iterating through arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>9) Shape of Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>10) Reshaping Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>11) Joining Arrays using Numpy in Python</p><p>12) Splitting Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>13) Sorting an Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>14) Searching in Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>15) Filtering an Array using Numpy in Python</p><p>16) Generating a Random Array using Numpy in Python</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Arrays in Numpy are equivalent to lists in python. Like lists in python, the Numpy arrays are homogenous sets of elements. The most important feature of NumPy arrays is they are homogenous in nature. This differentiates them from python arrays. It maintains uniformity for mathematical operations that would not be possible with heterogeneous elements. Another benefit of using NumPy arrays is there are a large number of functions that are applicable to these arrays. These functions could not be performed when applied to python arrays due to their heterogeneous nature.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Happy learning</p><p>Surendra Varma Pericherla</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>Presentation Skills</strong> course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their <strong>Presentation Skills</strong> for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this <strong>Presentation Skills</strong> course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your virtual <strong>Presentation Skills</strong> right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out virtually as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards.&nbsp;</p><p>\"5 Stars! Practical! Practical! Practical! I learned so much from this FREE course. I am not a newbie speaker and I still got so much out of it. Did I mention that it was all FREE?

And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now.

You might ask for outside investment, raise capital, or join or acquire a like-minded company.</p><p>A business and, most importantly, its customers can suffer if the cart is put before the horse. The following key fundamentals need to be in place before getting bigger.</p><p>Most people will tell you that having the \"right people\" is essential to growing a company. But what exactly does that mean? Some managers aren't ready to adapt to updated models, workflows, employees, or even leadership when they're trained on existing arrangements, methods, and concepts.</p><p>You might need growth training before expanding to make sure managers can keep guiding and empowering others. In order to ensure leaders are informed and delivering consistent messages, companies can start by involving their HR teams.</p><p>For maximum efficiency and autonomy, traditional retailers may operate a new subset of outlet stores with arm's length management. If there's an influx of updated products and innovation, a product company that uses an executive panel might find that this model isn't scalable. As a result, it's imperative to figure out what processes can actually keep the business operating.</p><p>Leading companies should not only do SWOT analyses, but also evaluate the above qualitative components before growing - or they'll risk internal disorganization. There is no one size fits all when it comes to growth drivers, but these solid principles will help you get started.</p><p>Business management skills and a solid understanding of the core business functions are essential to leading a team or being a successful entrepreneur.</p><p>In this master course you can learn the 5 Major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction of business fundamentals and business development</p><p>2. Fundamentals important and Key Areas of Business</p><p>3. Pillars, types and core areas of Business</p><p>4.

      "description": "<p>Master course in Leadership, How is Leadership Defined?</p><p>There are many definitions of leadership. Many lines have been written attempting to capture the essence in just a few words.</p><p>The Oxford English Dictionary definition of leadership is simply:</p><ul><li><p>\"<em>The action of leading a group of people or an organisation, or the ability to do this </em>.\"</p></li></ul><p>We need now to define 'lead' in this context, which is more helpful with regards to appreciating the breadth and depth of the word 'leadership'. Here are the most relevant points from the dictionary:</p><ul><li><p>Be in charge or command</p></li><li><p>Organise and direct</p></li><li><p>Set a process in motion</p></li><li><p>Be a reason or motive for (others to act, change, etc.)</p></li></ul><p>Note that only the first point strongly implies that leadership depends on a single leader, and even this point may easily be interpreted to mean that it can be achieved by delegated responsibility, even across a number of levels and on a vast scale.</p><p>Also consider that the last two points do not restrict leadership to the leading of an organised group of people such as a business or other provider of services/products, etc. The last two points broaden the scope to anyone or any collective of people, who inspire or motivate other people to act in some way towards some sort of aim or task or outcome.</p><p>Effective leadership requires collaboration between the leaders and the followers. There are times that leadership will demand a lot from the followers. But leaders should know the best way to bring out the best from people.</p><p>Self-leadership : All leadership, however, should begin with oneself. Any person who wants to be a leader needs to have a great degree of discipline. Leaders are also committed to learning and self-improvement. Warren Bennis effectively outlined effective leadership, which consists of five key practices and principles.</p><p>First, know yourself.</p><p>Have a vision.</p><p>Communicate the vision.</p><p>Build trust.</p><p>Take effective action.</p><p>In this master course, you can learn 5 major topics,</p><p>1. Introduction and importance of leadership</p><p>2. Leadership behaviour, traits, skills, and abilities</p><p>3. Styles of leadership</p><p>4. Leadership in Business</p><p>5.

      "description": "<p><strong>Hi and welcome to our introduction to the basics of Digital Marketing, Social Media, and SEO. Make sure you’re sitting comfortably, as you’re about to get a comprehensive overview of everything related to digital marketing. This Digital Marketing Course is filled with HQ animated explainers with HQ voice overs followed by interactive quizzes and practical writing assignments. Learning made fun and organic!</strong></p><p>If you want to be successful online today, you NEET to have strong Digital marketing skills as internet business has never been more competitive. In this introduction, we’ll outline the basics of SEO, Digital Marketing and Social Media and break each of these topics down, so you understand the most essential things you need to know. You’ll learn key tips for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Instagram, Email, and Twitter Marketing, Growth Hacking, and so much more.</p><p>In this Digital Marketing Course for Beginners, we’ve outlined the most crucial pieces of information on the most important topics related to digital marketing, social media, and SEO. This is a core first step on your learning journey as it will help you to quickly lay down the foundations and is a great place to start if you want a career in digital marketing or want to be successful marketing online.</p><p><strong>What is Digital Marketing?</strong></p><p>Digital marketing is vital if you have a business or want to sell anything online. Even if you’re just looking to build profile, you need a strong internet presence, if you want people to know you exist. The purpose of Digital Marketing is to raise awareness, connect with people who are interested in what you’re offering, and persuade them to take actions you want. It uses digital forms of communication like the web, smartphones, social media platforms, and search engines, as a medium to reach potential customers.</p><p>Just like traditional marketing, digital marketing, is about finding prospective customers and broadcasting your message to them in the right place, in the right tone, and at the right time.</p><p>Digital Marketing has one major advantage over traditional marketing as you can use analytics tools to monitor your campaigns in real time, so you can swiftly adjust your approach. Typically, it would cost more and take longer to make these kinds of adjustments, but with Digital Marketing it’s easier to course correct than it would be if you had invested in a print ad.</p><p><strong>What is Social Media?</strong></p><p>Social Media is an umbrella term to describe online platforms focused on community-based communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Platforms like this use content sharing and post interaction, and most of there is content produced being from the users not the owners of the platform. Social media also includes curation sites such as wikis, as well as professional networking platforms like LinkedIn.</p><p>Due to the massive reach of Social Media, good social media marketing skills are now essential for anyone looking to attract the maximum number of customers online.</p><p><strong>What is SEO?</strong></p><p>SEO, or Search engine optimization, is the science of attracting specific types of traffic to a website using a search engine. To master SEO, you need to create high-value content with high authority backlinks and include keywords in that content that your ideal customers search for.</p><p>SEO is never a one size fits all solution, to be successful, you must take a bespoke approach. That means you need to optimise your site for the type of search engine you want it to rank highly on, like Google, Amazon, or Bing. SEO typically focuses on scoring highly organic search results, not paid or sponsored traffic, but you can also use it in paid ads, to maximise their reach.</p><p>As search engines attempt to give the most suitable answer to each person’s search query, you must ensure a search engine views your site as the most appropriate match.</p><p>Every search engine uses a different algorithm to determine what the best result to a search query is. This will include a combination of different factors, including the quality of your content and backlinks, how many visitors your site has, and your website’s speed and uptime.</p><p>Modern SEO is complex, and mastering it takes more than just getting the right meta tags. It includes understanding how rich snippets, video, and featured snippets work to enhance your rankings as well as the importance of voice search and Video SEO. If you want to be successful using Google Search, you also need to understand how Google Rank Brain scores your website and must optimise your site to score highly on Google’s algorithm.</p><p>Local SEO is also becoming more critical, and you will need to learn the basics of this, especially since nearly half of all Google searches now have a local intent. Near Me searches have grown even faster, exploding at a rate of 150% more than local searches alone.</p><p>Mastering SEO also includes understanding Technical SEO, which focuses on priming your website for crawling and indexing by search engines. It’s important you don’t neglect this aspect, as without it search engines will find it much more difficult to access, crawl, and index your website. As a result, you will rank much lower. The reason this process is referred to as “Technical SEO” is because it has nothing to do with promoting your website and or the type of SEO you include in your content.</p><p><strong>How can Copywriting &amp; Content Marketing benefit you?</strong></p><p>From your sales pages to your press releases, video scripts, blog post headlines meta descriptions, and email campaigns to your Facebook posts and Press releases, knowing how to create great copy will help your marketing efforts enormously. When you learn how to do it right, you'll be able to get higher conversion rates on key pages, improve the structure of your blogs, get more engagement in social media, and have many more people share your content.</p><p>Most importantly of all, you'll be able to understand your customer’s needs, which will help you connect with your target audience much better. To create truly great copy, you first need to know your audience. You must understand what drives them, their hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears and desires.</p><p>Once you have this knowledge, you'll be able to write copy that immediately connects with the people you're trying to reach, because you'll be speaking their language. This will make all your content 100% more effective, and you'll find it easier to be able to get people to take the action you want.</p><p>Knowing how to write good copy is an essential marketing skill, that will help you boost your reach, sell more, and get more customer engagement. It will also make you much more employable, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73% of employers want to hire people with strong writing skills.</p><p><strong>How to create content for YouTube?</strong></p><p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to plan content that appeals to your audience, how to shoot for success, and define your own unique content style. You’ll also discover some easy editing tricks that will polish up your videos to a professional looking standard.</p><p>You’ll learn…</p><ul><li><p>How to plan for a perfect shoot</p></li><li><p>How to create a memorable video style</p></li><li><p>How to shoot great content that your viewers will love</p></li><li><p>How to easily edit your videos</p></li><li><p>How to choose the most effective equipment - and get it at the best price</p></li><li><p>And more tips and techniques to take your YouTube game up a notch</p></li></ul><p>We’ve really passionate about helping our students produce great content for YouTube as we know this is the No1 essential key to success on the platform.

Remember, it may take a little bit of time and effort, but we know you can do this, and we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>Why to focus on the first 15 seconds?</strong></p><p>The first 15 seconds of your video is so important that YouTube even mentions this - because this is the make-or-break time period where your viewers will decide whether to continue watching or go elsewhere.</p><p>If you can wow viewers with an enticing first 15 seconds, chances are you’ll have hooked them in, and they’ll stay on to watch the rest of your content. Regardless of how much planning you intend to do, it’s always worthwhile thoroughly planning out <em>this</em> part of your video.</p><p>To create a truly great first 15 seconds, you first need a “hook”, which is something that will get people initially excited, so they want to stick around to watch what’s coming next. Think about your target viewer demographic when creating your hook, what is it they want to learn or find out about and how can you communicate that they’ll get this if they stick around?</p><p><strong>How to use the YouTube Cards?</strong></p><p>YouTube Cards allow you to add interactive elements to your content and this is an extremely useful feature if you’re looking to promote something. Cards can be used to get almost anything<em> </em>you can imagine in front of your audience, from your merchandise to your blog, as well as your other content, and playlists.</p><p>Viewers can see your YouTube Cards whether they are watching on a mobile device or on a desktop, and you should certainly make use of this feature, as Cards can give you a helpful boost, where you need it most.</p><p><strong>How to find affordable high-performance equipment?</strong></p><p>If you do want to invest in some equipment to shoot with, we’ll show you how to pick up an affordable, high-quality right that will take your YouTube content to the next level.</p><p><strong>How to plan shooting?</strong></p><p>Planning is also an important component when it comes to your actual video shoot. There are several elements you will need to prepare beforehand, from setting up your lighting to deciding on the camera angles you will be using in your video.</p><p>If you plan your shoot in advance and think ahead to the editing stage, you’ll save yourself a lot of editing time. You’ll also get a far better result when you actually hit the record button.</p><p><strong>When you enrol, you also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Course Materials and Tuition Worth at Least $1.200 - you get it all - for a tiny fraction of the cost!!</p></li><li><p>Handy PDF &amp; MP3 packed with useful and Extra Resources you can download from our Resource Centre</p></li><li><p>Interactive Quizzes &amp; Writing Assignments</p></li><li><p>Lifetime access &amp; Lifetime updates</p></li><li><p>Udemy certificate of completion - ready for download</p></li><li><p>30-day money back guaranteed by Udemy</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; friendly support in the Q&amp;A section - ask me a question anytime</p></li></ul><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about Digital Marketing!</strong></p><p><strong>We look forward to welcoming you on board as my newest student!</strong></p><p>Yours</p><p>Ing.

      "description": "<p>In a corner of the internet where there are no rules, there is a group of people who do not play by the rules. These are the hackers and crackers who cross lines and get away with it.</p><p>It's been around for a long time. There are entire generations of hackers that merely know how to utilize exploits; So what is an exploit?</p><p>In the security software industry, an exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized).</p><p>In simple terms: A vulnerability is a bug in code that can be triggered by an attacker and an exploit is the method used to trigger the bug.</p><p>A vulnerability on its own is just a potential risk. It must be exploited before it becomes a problem. For example, having your car broken into is not good, but having your car broken into and then your laptop stolen is very bad indeed.</p><p>This course teaches you the basics of exploits and how to apply them (to Ubuntu Linux). It is a beginners course and requires no programming knowledge (we won't do programming in this course). You will apply some exploits, one of which will even make you a root user (administrator) on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.</p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "<p>Anyone who has had the good fortune to hear an <strong>orchestra brilliantly</strong> perform a symphony composed by one of the great masters knows that each of the carefully tuned musical instruments contributes to the collective, harmonious sound </p><p>produced by the musicians. In many ways, the normally tuned immune system continuously plays an orchestrated </p><p>symphony to maintain homeostasis.</p><p><strong>The immune system is a “team effort,</strong>” involving many different players. These players can be divided roughly into two groups: those that are members of the innate immune system team and those that are part of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, these two groups work together to provide a powerful defense against invaders. </p><p>Immunology is a difficult subject for several reasons. First, there are lots of details, and sometimes these details get in </p><p>the way of understanding the concepts. To get around this problem, we’re going to concentrate on the big picture. It </p><p>will be easy for you to find the details somewhere else. Another difficulty in learning immunology is that there </p><p>is an exception to every rule. Immunologists love these exceptions, because they give clues as to how the immune </p><p>system functions. But for now, we’re just going to learn the rules. Oh sure, we’ll come upon exceptions from time </p><p>to time, but we won’t dwell on them. Our goal is to exam-ine the immune system, stripped to its essence.</p><p>A third difficulty in studying immunology is that our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving. As </p><p>you’ll see, there are many unanswered questions, and some of the things that seem true today will be proven </p><p>false tomorrow. </p><p><strong>The term “immunology</strong>” is derived from Latin word “immunis” means exempt, i.e., protection from infectious diseases. Extensive work on bacteriology and pathology made their respective workers to find methods to develop resistance against infectious diseases in the latter half of 19th and beginning of 20th century. Although the history of immunology is about 100 years old, cellular immunology dates back to the 1950s</p><p><strong>why is immunology so important?</strong> The immune system has involvement in almost all fields related to health and disease. Infections continue to confront human health and well-being on a global scale. Inflammation contributes to the </p><p>lung, heart and joint diseases, and diabetes mellitus; cancers have to evade immune surveillance, and immune dysregulation leads to allergies that are increasingly prevalent across the world. Only improved understanding of the </p><p>mechanisms by which microbes, allergens, and tumor cells cause disease will result in the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies to combat this threat.However, we are only beginning the voyage of immunology, and there is much we still need to research and understand. The study of basic immunology may provide students with an opportunity to relate the findings of fundamental sciscientific investigations to clinical problems</p><p><strong>history</strong></p><p>Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (2000 B. C.) records the presence of pestilence and diseases. The study of Immunology stemmed out from the Thucydides’ description of individuals who recovered from the plague in Athens. Those individuals, who had already contracted the disease, recovered and became “immune.” Variolation was practiced for many years in China. The process involved exposing healthy people to the material derived from the lesions caused by the disease by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules into the nose. However, that occasionally resulted in death because there was no standardization of the inoculum. Variolation, later, became popular </p><p>in England, mainly due to the efforts of Lady Mary Wortley Montague and the American colonies. In 1796, Jenner inoculated James Phipps with the material obtained from a cowpox lesion, which appeared on the hand of a </p><p>dairymaid, and he inoculated the experimental subject with smallpox about six weeks later, without producing disease [1]. In 1875, Robert Koch was able to show the presence of anthrax causing bacteria in the lymph nodes of a dead rabbit that was earlier inoculated with the blood of a diseased animal [2]. In a serendipitous discovery, Pasteur was able to attenuate the virulent chicken cholera bacillus and coined the term vaccination. Later, he developed first viable vaccine for anthrax and rabies while Robert Koch studied hypersensitivity in tuberculosis. Although many consider Louis Pasteur the “father of </p><p>immunology,” it is due to his and Koch’s efforts that firmly established the historical germ theory of disease. Then, various scientists contributed to the development of the concept of cellular and humoral immunity. While working on the development of digestive organ in starfish larvae, Metchnikoff became a leading proponent of the “Cellularists.” He believed that phagocytes, not antibodies, played the leading role in immunity. Emil von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated the transfer of immunity against Diphtheria by a soluble “anti-toxin” in the blood&nbsp; whereby, Paul Ehrlich predicted the existence of immune bodies (antibodies) and side-chains from which they arise (receptors). Ehrlich suggested that antigens interact with receptors borne by cells, resulting in the secretion of excess receptors (antibodies).the supporters of alternative theory, i.e., “Humoralists,” believed that a soluble substance in the body was responsible for mediating immunity </p><p><strong> OVERVIEW OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></p><p><strong>PHYSICAL BARRIERS</strong></p><p><strong>immunological mechanisms</strong></p><p>THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM</p><p>THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM</p><p>organ of immune system</p><p>cells of immune system</p><p>Antigen</p><p>Macrophage</p><p>what is immune response ?</p><p>immunoglobulin</p><p>immunotolerance</p><p>histocompatibility</p><p>immunotherapy</p><p>cytokines</p><p>complement system</p><p>Regulation of immune response</p><p>immunity to infection</p><p>transplantation immunology</p><p>autoimmune diseases</p><p>hypersensitivity </p><p>immunization</p><p>tumor immunology</p><p>immunodiagnostics</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.”</em> - Eric N<br><br>★★★★★ \"Wow! I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I can’t believe how much Ali and Sumner packed into it, it was full of easy to understand, practical information on how to step up your Etsy store from A-Z. I just took another course on Udemy for succeeding on Etsy which I was really highly rated, it was a lot shorter and I after it I thought I knew all I needed to know to get a great start but at the last minute thought I’d check this course out too, I couldn’t put my lap top away, seriously guys thank you so much, I barely learnt anything from that first course! I’m so pumped to get started now!!!\" - <em>Janelle T</em></p><p><br></p><p>★★★★★ <em>“It is kind of hard to describe the quantity of information Sumner communicates in this course. It's a long course (19.5hrs). During the whole time Sumner is fresh, prepared and he clearly explains all topics. And I mean ALL topics. He covers all areas of Amazon FBA but then goes further with pointers to other aspects of e-commerce which you can explore. I have an amazing number of new bookmarks pointing to critical tools in my browser and a huge number of bookmarks within the course.

Text to speech systems was first developed to help the visually impaired by providing the user with a spoken voice created by a machine that would \"read\" text. </p><p>Text to speech enables content owners to adapt in terms of how they communicate with the content to the specific needs and desires of each user.</p><p>Businesses, Organizations, and Publishers that utilize TTS (Text to Speech) technology benefit from:&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p><em>Enhanced customer experience</em></p></li><li><p><em>Effective branding</em></p></li><li><p><em>Global market penetration </em></p></li><li><p><em>Optimized development and maintenance </em></p></li><li><p><em>More autonomy for the digital content owner</em></p></li><li><p><em>Saved time and also, money</em></p></li><li><p><em>Easier implementation with Internet of Things (IoT)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Word-of-mouth marketing</em></p></li><li><p><em>Increased web presence across markets</em></p></li><li><p><em>Enhanced employee performance</em></p></li></ul><p>This is a mind-blowing and unbelievable new course on&nbsp;Text-to-Speech (TTS)&nbsp;software that you'll never forget. Text-to-Speech takes the written text and transforms it into speech, for that matter. This incredible technology offers several benefits to cater to the needs of consumers, businesses, personal users and educational institutions. Be it a business looking for your next competitive edge or a personal learning student looking to learn a new language or to find your new voice, Text-to-Speech software can be implemented in a variety of ways to help you achieve your goals get your desired content. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence AudioBook&nbsp;Creation will help you research on content using AI, convert them into audio (obviously, a bot can breathe, before speaking a sentence) and later convert them into video podcasts (vlogs)&nbsp;for that matter - all with the power of using Artificial Intelligence - all using various AI&nbsp;tools available on the web.</p><p>The use of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) in&nbsp;Audiobook creation is a must to know about - as this has the technology to change the world of education, all together. You can also use this tech to go ahead in creating Private Label Rights (PLR)&nbsp;audiobooks to upload on portals like YouTube,&nbsp;Vimeo, Dailymotion etc.&nbsp;One more advanced technology discussed in the course covers the secret technique of \"Voice Cloning\" that allows you to clone your voice forever.&nbsp;So, what are you waiting for?&nbsp;The power of Artificial Intelligence for TTS&nbsp;awaits you, to the core.</p><p>TTS gives a larger number of people, access to your content, such as those with difficulties in literacy, learning disabilities, reduced vision and language learning. It also opens doors to anyone else in need of easy ways to access digital content.&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence usage in&nbsp;TTS goes a long way to play an important role in the creation process of TTS based Audiobooks.</p><p>Enroll now, get started today to evoke the brilliance of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence usage of TTS (text to speech) and be wow'ed like you never have been. This is the time for AI to rule the audiobook universe and beyond.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>What moves cryptocurrency markets?</strong></p><p>Cryptocurrency markets move according to supply and demand. However, as they are decentralized, they tend to remain free from many of the economic and political concerns that affect traditional currencies. While there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, the following factors can have a significant impact on their prices:</p><ul><li><p>Supply: the total number of coins and the rate at which they are released, destroyed or lost</p></li><li><p>Market capitalization: the value of all the coins in existence and how users perceive this to be developing</p></li><li><p>Press: the way the cryptocurrency is portrayed in the media and how much coverage it is getting</p></li><li><p>Integration: the extent to which the cryptocurrency easily integrates into existing infrastructure such as e-commerce payment systems</p></li><li><p>Key events: major events such as regulatory updates, security breaches and economic setbacks</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is cryptocurrency trading?</strong></p><p>Cryptocurrency trading is the act of speculating on cryptocurrency price movements via a CFD trading account, or buying and selling the underlying coins via an exchange.</p><p><strong>CFD trading on cryptocurrencies</strong></p><p>CFDs trading are derivatives, which enable you to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements without taking ownership of the underlying coins. You can go long (‘buy’) if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value, or short (‘sell’) if you think it will fall.</p><p>Both are leveraged products, meaning you only need to put up a small deposit – known as margin – to gain full exposure to the underlying market. Your profit or loss are still calculated according to the full size of your position, so leverage will magnify both profits and losses.</p><p>Buying and selling cryptocurrencies via an exchange</p><p>When you buy cryptocurrencies via an exchange, you purchase the coins themselves. You’ll need to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you’re ready to sell.</p><p>Exchanges bring their own steep learning curve as you’ll need to get to grips with the technology involved and learn how to make sense of the data. Many exchanges also have limits on how much you can deposit, while accounts can be very expensive to maintain.</p><p><strong>How do cryptocurrency markets work?</strong></p><p>Cryptocurrency markets are decentralized, which means they are not issued or backed by a central authority such as a government. Instead, they run across a network of computers. However, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold via exchanges and stored in ‘wallets’ .</p><p>Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies exist only as a shared digital record of ownership, stored on a blockchain. When a user wants to send cryptocurrency units to another user, they send it to that user’s digital wallet. The transaction isn’t considered final until it has been verified and added to the blockchain through a process called mining. This is also how new cryptocurrency tokens are usually created.</p><p><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></p><p>A blockchain is a shared digital register of recorded data. For cryptocurrencies, this is the transaction history for every unit of the cryptocurrency, which shows how ownership has changed over time. Blockchain works by recording transactions in ‘blocks’, with new blocks added at the front of the chain.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Scammers are using social media to perpetuate giveaway scams. They post screenshots of forged messages from companies and executives promoting a giveaway with hyperlinks to fraudulent websites. Fake accounts will then respond to these posts affirming the scam as legitimate. The fraudulent websites will then ask that you “verify” your address by sending cryptocurrency to the scam giveaway.</p><p><strong>How To Avoid Cryptocurrency Scams</strong></p><p>Scammers are always finding new ways to steal your money using cryptocurrency. <strong>One sure sign of a scam is anyone who says you have to pay by cryptocurrency. </strong>In fact, anyone who tells you to pay by wire transfer, gift card, or cryptocurrency is a scammer. Of course, if you pay, there’s almost no way to get that money back. Which is what the scammers are counting on. Here are some cryptocurrency scams to watch out for.</p><p><strong>Investment and business opportunity scams</strong></p><ul><li><p>Some companies promise that you can earn lots of money in a short time and achieve financial freedom.</p></li><li><p>Some scammers tell you to pay in cryptocurrency for the right to recruit others into a program. If you do, they say, you’ll get recruitment rewards paid in cryptocurrency. The more cryptocurrency you pay, the more money they promise you’ll make. But these are all fake promises, and false guarantees.</p></li><li><p>Some scammers start with unsolicited offers from supposed “investment managers.” These scammers say they can help you grow your money if you give them the cryptocurrency you’ve bought. But once you log in to the “investment account” they opened, you’ll find that you can’t withdraw your money unless you pay fees.</p></li><li><p>Some scammers send unsolicited job offers to help recruit cryptocurrency investors, sell cryptocurrency, mine cryptocurrency, or help with converting cash to bitcoin.</p></li><li><p>Some scammers list scam jobs on job websites. They’ll promise you a job (for a fee), but end up taking your money or personal information.</p></li></ul><p>Look for claims like these to help you spot the companies and people to avoid:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scammers guarantee that you’ll make money</strong>. If they promise you’ll make a profit, that’s a scam. Even if there’s a celebrity endorsement or testimonials. (Those are easily faked.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Scammers promise big payouts with guaranteed returns</strong>. Nobody can guarantee a set return, say, double your money. Much less in a short time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scammers promise free money</strong>. They’ll promise it in cash or cryptocurrency, but free money promises are always fake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scammers make big claims without details or explanations.</strong> Smart business people want to understand how their investment works, and where their money is going. And good investment advisors want to share that information.</p></li></ul><p>Before you invest, check it out. Research online for the name of the company and the cryptocurrency name, plus words like “review,” “scam,” or “complaint.” See what others are saying. And read more about other common investment scams.</p><p><strong>Blackmail emails</strong></p><p>Scammers will often send emails that say they have embarrassing or compromising photos, videos, or personal information about you. Then, they threaten to make it public unless you pay them in cryptocurrency. Don’t do it. This is blackmail and a criminal extortion attempt. Report it to the FBI immediately.</p><p><strong>Social media scams</strong></p><p>If you read a tweet, text, email, or get a message on social media that tells you to send cryptocurrency, it’s a scam. That’s true even if the message came from someone you know, or was posted by a celebrity you follow. Their social media accounts might have been hacked.</p>",

The student is instead empowered to perform the routine from anywhere, at any time, from the development of body memory (aka habit).</p><p>The slow deep breathing aspect allows the body and mind to be calm, releasing stress and anxiety. It’s very meditative. The fast rhythmic breathing allows the body to re-energize by activating circulation and pumping oxygen into the blood stream. The student can choose the desired outcome and vary the routine based on their needs, increasing the speed, or slowing it down even more, developing their skill in either direction, as needed to incorporate in their day, and life.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Whether we realize it or not, we are surrounded by persuasion every day. Not only from advertisements and various other media, but also from the people we know.&nbsp; There are very few days that go by where there isn't someone trying to get us to do or believe something. Persuasion is a part of life. However, whether our attempts at persuasion <em>actually work</em> is a different story. Some people are quite effective at getting what they want; others are not. The difference between the two is often dependent upon the approach taken. This course hopes to offer some insight into <em>how </em>to effectively persuade people. It also seeks to teach you how to identify when others are masterfully trying to persuade *you*.&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em> We want you to be able to identify it when you see it and be able to use it when you need it. </p><p>The first part of the class explores the concept of <em>rhetoric. </em>If language had a form of martial arts, <em>rhetoric </em>would be it. Thus, since we all use language every day, it would be silly not to equip ourselves with the techniques and insights it offers. You may have heard some variation of the saying: 'you shouldn't bring rocks to a gunfight'. Well, when it comes to persuasion, knowing rhetoric is the equivalent of bringing a bazooka... or perhaps a bulletproof vest, as it reveals the fundamentals behind all persuasion. </p><p>The second part of class builds upon the concepts of rhetoric by covering eight (8) easy language-based techniques anyone can use at any tine to persuade an audience. These tactics include using the <em>LESS&nbsp;technique, Cognitive Dissonance, </em>and <em>Loaded Words</em>, to name a few. These are simple but highly effective tactics you can begin using immediately to be more convincing. </p><p>It has been said that a person's inherent morals are only revealed once they have power. Thus, we implore you: please use this knowledge for good, not evil, because in many ways, it truly offers access to a real-world superpower.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p><br></p>",

Have you joined multiple courses for basically learning the same thing over and over again? Have you been thinking why there is no complete course out there where you can learn how to become master of front and back end development with the latest, greatest, and the most modern programming/designing techniques?</p><p><strong>Great news: Then This Is The Right Course For You!</strong></p><p>Welcome to \"<strong>Ultimate PHP, CSS, and Sass: Enhance Your JavaScript Skills, best course ever</strong>\". This is the most advanced, the most modern, and the most up to date course ever on this platform. It's everything you need to become master and advance your career as a graduate student, junior developer, or programmer. <strong> Look at the end of why I create this course to be for everyone.</strong></p><p>There are multiple parts to this course. The first part is the designing process where you will learn how to use HTML, CSS, and Sass. You will be able to design and create modern layouts on your own after finishing this part. You will learn the most complex and advanced responsive design techniques<strong>, CSS GRID and Flexbox layouts </strong>and yes you will get familiar with <strong>Bootstrap </strong>as well. You will become a master of Sass, and CSS architecture also yo<strong>u will be able to design 3 very many different landing pages</strong> for these projects so you can get experience and practice what we have learned and put that in practice. You will have<strong> 2 complete guides for CSS GIRD and Flexbox </strong>in this section in order to make your life easy. This course is all about design, and you will be the architect of 3 different and beautifully designed and crafted projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>FIRST&nbsp;PART&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;CSS AND&nbsp;SASS, FLEXBOX, CSS-GRID AND&nbsp;BOOTSTRAP INTRO:</strong></p><p><strong><em>1) Create layouts of every kind with the latest cutting-edge layout technologies.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2) You master Flexbox and CSS Grid and Bootstrap;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>3) Design carefully for all kind of devices with media queries;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>4) Understand the concepts of CSS and how you can make reusable code that is easily maintainable with Sass.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you will get familiar with<strong> background-clip, transform, and perspectives when we are making rotating/flipping cards.</strong> You will use <strong>clip-path</strong> to shape the footer and header. Also, you will be able to create animations using <strong>@keyframes, transitions, and animation</strong>.</p><p>Working on these projects you will be able to use CSS selectors and pseudo-classes, elements that are the foundation of the modern CSS. Dealing with complex scenarios you will l<strong>earn parent, child inheritance, box types, and positioning elements using abstract and relative positioning</strong>. This course will be based on <strong>7-1 rul</strong>e and we will stick with the <strong>BEM methodology</strong> so you can create massive code components that will be very easy for maintenance and at the same time expandable and scalable. With Sass, we will use variables where we declare their values and after that, we will use them in our project whenever we need them. You will learn how to use media queries and create ones where our design breaks, meaning that you can adjust your design to fit all kinds of screen sizes by simple and advanced calculation.</p><p>Flexbox and CSS grid will give us the opportunity to learn the process of organizing our website into a layout that easily fits different screen widths. I have two crash courses and examples for these two particular layouts. Additionally, we will use font awesome icons but we also will learn how to use the modern <strong>SVG </strong>icons in our projects so we can understand the difference between them. You will know how to change <strong>SVG color and generate SVG sprites</strong> with a breeze. On top of this, we will use the <strong>NPM </strong>so we can <strong>compile Sass</strong> and every code changes will automatically be reloaded on the browser. <strong>You will get familiar with the processes how to concatenate, prefix and compress and compile CSS file;</strong></p><p><strong>SECOND&nbsp;PART&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE PHP, PDO, MYSQL, SECURITY AND&nbsp;OOP INTRO:</strong></p><p>The second part of this course is <strong>PDO PHP and OOP using Classes, methods and etc.</strong> We will not use the<strong> entire MVC framework</strong> but we will get familiar with how to use <strong>M from that framework which stands for MODELS. </strong>Inside this model folder, we will create our core functions that will interact with the database in a secure manner. Security is the number one feature of PDO so that is why we are going to do our projects with PDO.<strong> I have created a crash course on how to use Classes and PDO</strong> just for this project so if you are a person with limited PHP understanding you will not have a problem after the crash course to follow this part.</p><p><strong>What you will learn in this part:</strong></p><p>You will learn that <strong>PDO represents PHP data objects </strong>and a lean and consistent way to connect to a <strong>Database</strong>. Also, <strong>PDO </strong>can work with multiple different databases like <strong>MySQL, Firebird, Oracle, PostgreSQL, </strong>and lots more. PDO provides secure data access layer no matter what type of system you are using, you can still use the same functions to access this data. <strong>You need to use a PHP 5.4 </strong>or later version in order to work because<strong> PDO will need OOP features.</strong> The biggest advantage for which I choose to use PDO is that we can write <strong>prepared statements </strong>that will <strong>prevent SQL attacks</strong> and injections that can destroy what we have stored in the database.<strong> PDO is very usable and reusable, usable</strong> because it has lots of functions out there that we can use like fetch and error handling, and reusable means that it can <strong>access multiple databases because of its unified API</strong>. We will write so many create, read, update, delete queries that by the end of this course you will become the master of PHP. You will become a master of <strong>PHP PDO and get to know the three main Classes like PDO, PDOStatment, and PDOexception</strong>. For these reasons, I have also included lectures about<strong> OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Classes</strong> where I discuss what is Class and how to use them in our project. <strong>You will learn how to instantiate objects of that class</strong> and how these objects can interact and use the methods/functions of a parent class. In addition, we will discuss Abstract and Extend Classes. In addition, you will learn how to take payments using PHP Stripe API, and PHP SDK for PayPal RESTful APIs. </p><p>After that, we can send emails to our users/customers <strong>using PHPMailer</strong> and we can <strong>install it via Composer</strong>. In short, you will learn how to use a composer or dependency management tool for managing dependencies of PHP software and required libraries.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other smaller things worth mentioning:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>1)Password Hashing &amp; Security in PHP</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2)Variables, Constants &amp; Super Global</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>3) Arrays in PHP</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>4)Loops like While, foreach, for and etc</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>5)Control Structures </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>6)Methods or Functions</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>7)Sessions</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>8)Store and move FILES</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>9)Authentication</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>10)PHPMailer to send emails and files</em></strong></p><p><strong>11) Take Payments With Stripe and Paypal</strong></p><p><br></p><p> <strong>THIRD PART&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE JAVASCRIPT, AJAX and JQUERY</strong> <strong>INTRO:</strong></p><p>Although there will be no separate third part it will be included with the PHP part because we need to do a lot of the things on the website using <strong>JavaScript </strong>and <strong>JQuery</strong>. So in this last part, I want to discuss why we are going to use JavaScript and Ajax to finish our project. Although this course is not about learning <strong>JavaScript </strong>and <strong>Ajax </strong>you will still learn a lot during this course. So what is AJAX?</p><p>AJAX is an acronym that stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and it describes a set of development techniques used for building websites and web applications. Ajax's core function is to update web content <strong>asynchronously </strong>(the \"A\" of AJAX), meaning you will not need to reload an entire web page when only a<strong> small portion of the content on that page is updated</strong>. <strong>\"J\" stands for JavaScript </strong>and JavaScript will be used to hide and show notification or messages when we are deleting and saving data. Also, we will display alert messages with the help of JavaScript. Login and registration will be done <strong>using JavaScript regular expressions</strong> so we can validate input form data before storing it in our database. With the help of Ajax, we will create Ajax dependent dropdown select. Because this is a real project that requires a lot of things to be done, we need to use Ajax and JavaScript in order to keep our design feels and look very modern.</p><p>Finally, we will use<strong> Google Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding to display LAT and LNG</strong>, search for live places or particular addresses and finally store them into the database. <strong>Geo-coding </strong>will be<strong> used to convert the address that is in our DB</strong> into lat and long to display into the map on other pages. Additionally, we will learn how to place a marker, how to make custom icons for marker such as beach flag because I think that adding google maps into any website will make the website look more professional and clean.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>Before buying any course my recommendation is to look into the specification and curriculum of that course and also look at the project tour or how the application will look like. After reading and watching what has been created by the instructor/instructors then join that course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My promise to you?</strong></p><p><strong>I will always try to make you happy during the entire course, maybe sometimes over boring but that's me. I know that life is hard on its own and everyone has it's own problems so sharing info about my day and wishing you to be strong and positive is something that I will do in the lectures. It's never about how much money I will make from this course, it's what you will get out of this course. So promise that I will update the course constantly and listen to your requests and desires. </strong></p><p>Info that you need to know: In some lectures, the cursor pointer of my mouse is not visible but that should not stop you from taking this course, because this is a web development course where you can see me coding and my mouse is not going to be the problem. This is my mistake and is only there in the first part of this journey. My honesty is number one and I want you to know before joining the course. Also, I'm here for you in the Q&amp;A section, we will do everything together and I hope you will enjoy it.</p><p><strong>My Style</strong></p><p>I like to create things and achieve things that most people think that it's not possible or I'm not able to do this by myself. So don't be the person that will listen to others and never take the step forward.
